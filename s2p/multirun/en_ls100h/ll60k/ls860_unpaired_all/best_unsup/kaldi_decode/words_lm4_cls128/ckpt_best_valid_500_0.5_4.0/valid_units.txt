she called his name on the threshold and but in her swift flight across the room and she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly and that he could not tell just when she did it

in aristocratic countries the great possess immense privileges upon which their pride rests without seeking to rely upon the lesser advantages which accrue to them
they therefore entertain a calm sense of their spirit and they do not dream of vaunting privileges and which everyone perceives and had no one contested and these things are not sufficiently so to them and to be made topics of conversation
they stand and moved in their solitary greatness and well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves often done that no one will attempt to drive them from that position
when aristocracy carries on the public affairs this national pride naturally assuming this reserved indifferent and haughty form and which is it by all the other classes of the nation

peter told his troubles to mister shimerda and he was unable to meet a note which fell to on the first of november and had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing intended to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow

she asked peter to wait a moment and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts
we lay still and not talk
the little house on the hill side was so much the color of the night that we could not see it as we came up the rear
they made me think of defeated armies retreating and wore a ghost who were trying desperately to get in for shelter and and then went moaning on it
i could not take my eyes off the man in the bed and
the sharp smell of spirits went through the room
it seems to me that he despised him for being so simple and silent
the sick man raged and shook his fist
he seemed to be cursing people had wronged him in
quickly it was covered with bright red spots and i thought i had never seen any blood so bright
he lay patiently fighting for breath like a child with croup

their only three sledge is left he whispered in
and the wolves papa lass enough and enough for all of us
they were within a few miles of their religion
yes and how many men
twenty three enough
now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two
people knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him
peter crouching in the front seats saw nothing
the first thing i either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the keen air and louder than they had ever heard it before and the bell of the monastery of their own village ringing for early prayers
they were run out of their in
wherever they went the store followed them
they walked in chicago and in norway and but they were always unfortunate
during the action he went about with his head down and never lifted his eyes in
and everyone said peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her known

now their missionary that ever went out from iona had taught that to induce christians to slavery was wholly inconsistent with the belief in the doctrine of the gospel

margaret met jem wilson several days after his brothers were seriously ill and unheard from him the state of things at his home
she stopped with her hand on the latch of the wilson's door and to still her beating heart and and listened to the hushed quiet within
she opened the door softly and there sat missus wilson in the old rocking chair and with one sick deathlike boy lying on her knee and crying without let or paws and but softly gently and has fearing to disturb the troubled gasping child while behind her and old alice let her fast dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other women and which she was looking out on a board placed on a sort of sofa settee in the corner of the room and
over the child which yet breed the father bent and watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none

but earnest as the father was in watching the yet living and he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the deadened and sprang gently opened and took his dress and on his hard couch in his arms with tender strengthened and carried him upstairs and as if afraid of awakening him in
wishing him said mary in a tone of inquiry in
the other lifted up her voice and wept and
her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort her in
mary and alice drew near the fire and stood in a quiet sorrow for some time
then alice broke the silence by saying in
before christmas time and i was full as you could be of going home for good and all and you and heard her i wished this terrible time and
but he stayed long there and and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong gun
oh jem don't give way so i cannot bear to see you in
he did not speak and as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment and when her soft hand touch thrilled through his frame and and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ears
don't jem please don't whispered she again and believing that his silence was only another form of grief
mary i and almost both myself when i feel i would not give up this minute when my brothers lived and father and mother in such trouble and for all my life that's past and gone and married and as she tried to release her hand and you know what makes me feel so blest
he remained upstairs until after the early dawn showed mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet street to try and get a little sleep before worker
so leaving kind messages to george and jane wilson and and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to jem and decided that she had better not and she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been done
her thoughts ran on jim's manner and words and not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put so plainly in
i cannot think what possesses me and that i must always be wanting to comfort him when he's downcast and and that i must go meddling with him two nights when sure enough it was his aunt's place to speak to him
i think i cannot go right and friar checked myself till i'm downright crossed to him and or else i speak just naturally and and that kind and tender by half
but will he thank me for it
there was something of keen practical shrewdness about her and which contrasted very willingly with the simple and foolish inwardly ideas she had picked up and from the romances which missus young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other and yes
the old leaven diffused years ago by her aunt esther fermenting in her little bosom and and perhaps all the more for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle
it was a comfort to her when scolded by missus and to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage and to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker
but the best of her plans the lowliest and that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest and were those relating to her father her dear and now oppressed with care and always disheartened gloomy person
they sat about the house most of the day as if it were sunday and greasing their boots commending their suspenders plating whiplash in
anyway he would never allow one of his horse is to be put to such a strain
i had got to get some picture books for you uncle and antonia and have a new york was able to read a little now
she cut square of cotton cloth and sewed them together into a book

when he mounted his horse at the door and i saw that he had a hatchet slung at his belt and and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me
i put on my cap and ran out to meet jake
he used to help my father christmas trees for me in virginia london he had not forgotten how much i liked them in
by the time we had placed the cold fresh smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting room and it was already christmas eve
from under the lightning he now produced a collection of brilliantly colored paper figures several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone
i can see them now and exactly as they looked and walking about the table in the lamplight and jake with his heavy features so rudely mould that his face seemed somehow and finished and hot with his hat in hand the savage scar that made his upper lip curled so ferociously under his twisted moustache
grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat
morning prayers were longer than usual in
he gave thanks for food and comfort and and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities and where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us
because he talked so little and his words had a peculiar force and they were not more dull from constant use
all afternoon he sat in the dining room and
at about four o'clock a visitor appeared and mister omer and wearing his rabbit skin cap and collar and undo mittens his wife had knitting
he sat still and impassive and his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair and his hands relaxed upon the arms
his face had a look of weariness and pleasure and like that of sick people and when they feel relief from pain
he made the sign of the cross over me and put on his cap and went off in the dark
the week following christmas brought in authority and buy new year's day all the world about us was a broth of grace lush and and the gutter slope between the windmill and the bar was running black water
it was the first time missus shimerda had been to her and she ran about examining are carpets curtains and furniture and all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious complaining tone
your mamma i said angrily wants other people's thin
for more o my mamma come here
but you see and a body never knows what traits poverty might bring out in a minute
they began to laugh boisterous all when they saw me calling in
you've got a birthday present this time jim and no mistake
the narrative and it may be is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
in good faith however and he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore and relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod and or rather has by sticking up through the butterfly and thus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffened in ungainly and unnatural attitude
if permitted by the historical connection and which the slight was essential to his plan and the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
he trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending and by laying out a street that in fringes upon nobody's private rights and appropriating plot of land which had no visible owner and building a house of materials and long in use for constructing castles in the air
the inclosure had formerly been very extensive and but was now contracted with in small compass and hemmed about partly by high wooden fence is and partly by the out buildings of hers and that stood on the street
the white double rose bush had evidently been propped up a new against the house and since the commencement of the season and the pear tree and three damps and tea and which except rows of currant bushes and constituted the only varieties of fruit and bore marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs
there were also a few species of antique and red terry flowers and in no very flourishing condition and but scrupulously we did as if some persons and her out of love or curiosity and had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining
summer squashes almost in their gold and blossoms and cucumbers now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock and ramble far and wide and two or three rows of string beans and and as many more that were about to festooned themselves on poles and tomatoes occupying a sight so sheltered and sunny and that the plants were already gigantic and promised and early and abundant harvest
he wondered whose care and toil it could have been and that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
these two and strange to say and had thought it worth their while to come hither and possibly from the range of hives beside some farmhouse miles away
this was a fountain dust round with the rim of old mossy stones and paid in its bed and with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic work and of variously coloured pebbles
it now contained only not claire and his two wives and a solitary chicken
it was evident that the race has degenerated and like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict watchfulness to keep it pure in
these feathered people had existed too long indistinct variety a fact of which the present represent and judging by the lugubrious department seemed to be aware in
they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and snatched a chicken and not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose and what had once been so admirable a brood of fowls
the distinguishing mark of the hens and was the crest of lamentable scanty growth and in these latter days and but so oddly and wickedly analogous to his turban and that phoebe and to the point and stress of her conscience but inevitably and was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these four or by poison and respectable relative
the chicken crept through the pages of the group and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet and i shot claire and the ladies his household and regarded her with queer sidelong glance and then croaked one to another and has if communicating their sage opinions of her character
so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the ideal and not merely that they were the descendants of a time honored grace and but that they had existed and their individual compassed and ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
he held a whole in his hand and while he was gone in quest of the crumbs and had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes
they have known me much longer and but never honor me with any familiarity and though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
miss possible i suppose will it we've a fact with her other traditions and set down that the flowers no you to be a pension
ah but these hens said the young man and these heads of aristocratic lineage and would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barnyard fowl one
i prefer to think and so would miss hopes and that they recognized the family tone and for you are a pension
my name is phoebe penance said the girl and with the manner of some reserve and for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than that the great island of whose lawless propensities the old maid and had given her a disagreeable idea
i turned up the earth by way of past time
it is like a bandage over one's eyes to come into it
if you permit me said the artist looking at me and i should like to try whether the degree type can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
most of my likenesses do look and amiable and but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the original sin
there is a wonderful in sight in heaven is broad and simple sunshine
while we give it read it only for depicting the nearest circumstantially brings out the secret character with truth that no painter would venture upon uneven could he detect it
yet the original where to common eyes and a very different expression
he exhibited great pitcher and in a morocco case
he merely glanced at it and gave it back
i can assure you that this is a modern face and and one which you will very probably meat
the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be cut out of it and after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
here we have the man of science and hardened imperious and with all cold as ice and look at that day
and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original
well i don't wish to eat any more observed fee and turning away her eyes and it is certainly very like the old portrait
if the original is still in the world and i think he might defy the sun and to make him look stern and hard
is there nothing why did i continued whole grave and so earnestly that embarrassed fee and had also the quite freedom with which he resumed on their so recent acquaintance
it is nonsense said feel a little impatiently and for us to talk about a picture and which you have never seen
since you are a friend of my cousin helen you should ask her to show you the pit
so we will be fellow labours and somewhat in the community in
she did not altogether like him
owen rejoin'd the negro types and because like an old ladies cup of tea is water bewitched
she was distinctly aware however and that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman and was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs and a little withdrawn from the window and the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek and turned sideways tow'rds the corners
but put it on the table in a corner of the passage
but an instrument is a human voice
how wonderfully responsive to harry emotion of the human soul
fewer words than before and but with the same mysterious music in them
pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
i will sit in the parlor a wild and collect my thoughts
while thus dismissing her and the maiden lady stepped forward and kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart and which beat against the girl's bosom with a strong high and tumultuous well done
at some and a certain period in the depths of night and day and as it were through the thin veil of agreement she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force decision
preface to the second edition
this is a mistake the perfectly natural one
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revise to the prince
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two in spite of their entire independence to one another
i regret that if you have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines has an attempt to induce mister darwin theory to absurdity
i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious miss use of analogy would seem most naturally levelled and should have occurred to know if you neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hints given will suffice
but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain or was allowed almost to call them lifelong self deceivers to their face and and they said it was quite true but that did not matter
i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventure
it was written in the upper agate district of the canterbury province as it then was of new zealand and appeared at christchurch in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen o three
i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
d'ye see from my second preface that i took the book to miss yours chapman and hall and may first eighteen seventy one and and on their rejection of it and the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers and i let it sleep until i took it to mister trewin early in eighteen seventy two
distributes and looked for success mainly to two highly favorable if you and the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and in the second in the spectator of april twentieth
there was also another called in
the first edition of hair was sold in about three weeks and had not taken modes and and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken and but since the summer of eighteen seventy two and has new additions were from time to time wanted and they had been printed from streams then made
i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of it was that were repeatedly rewritten and but from those that had only a single writing and i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
this however may not be for the copyright will probably expires in a little over twelve year
if the reader will excuse me and i will say nothing of my antecedents and nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country and the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
it will be seen that i did not succeed in my designed and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange and i have been unable to keep any pecuniary advantage
no one who is himself honest will doubt my being so
i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight and but i dare not mention these and let the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was
sheep and cattle were instituted bread with extreme rapidity and men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country and going in land one behind the other until in a few years there was not an acre between the scene and the front ranges which was not taken up and and stations either for sheep or cattle were potted and about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong and this was no difficult matter and for there were not above eight hundred of them and and being all breeding used and they were pretty quiet
there were a good many sheep which china has two or three black used and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing marks whereby i could tell them
it is surprising how soon the becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep and out of two or three hundred
it was a monotonous life and it is very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one is well done
the country was the grandest that can be imagined
so lonely and so solomon with a sad grey clouds above and no sound save lost lamb bleeding upon the mountain side and has this little heart were breaking
he must cry louder and wandered farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stocked with borrowed capital and and consider myself a made man
there was no one in the whole world had the smallest idea and save those who were themselves on the other side of it and if indeed there was anyone at all and could i hope to cross it
i would try the train and see how far i could go in
shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon the village which stood up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
my guide however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any ink but they could not help liking me or i them
the streets were narrow and unpaid but very fairly clean
the vines grew outside many of the howards and there were some with sideboards on which was painted a bottle and glass that made me feel much at home
even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of split which had taken root and vegetative somehow and those in the air mercantile of the bleak it
each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes near being almost invariably perfect
their expression was divided and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment and i forgot all thoughts of their conversion feelings that were far more earth
even in middle age they were still comely and and the old gray haired woman at their cottage door had a dignity and not to say majesty of their own
the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
i have always delighted in and rarest beauty and but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type and a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
the children were infinite in number and exceedingly mary and i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guide and and they were greatly pleased
the country was highly cultivated hair legs being plant it with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
i saw a few sheep with round noses and enormous tales in
in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villagers we came upon a considerable towns and my guide made any attempt to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment to other people and who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome
in fact one of them was plainly very much out of helen and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
the other look pale and ill but he was marvelously self contained and and it is impossible to say what was the matter with him
they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
but by and by they came to my watch which had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had done had forgotten when they began their search
again there is a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay and i could see had been designed original or iron railing
we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watching
the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
this had some affecting calming him
he began presently to repent and spoke to me in a kinder man in
minnie's flat as the unfortunate apartments were then being called and was in a part of west van buren street inhabited by families of laborers and clerks and men who had come and were still coming with a rush of population pouring in at the rate of fifty thousand a year in
to carry the sound of the little bells upon the horse cars as they twinkled in and out of hearing was pleasing as it was novel
to him the presence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter of indifference
he was of a clean saving disposition and adore dea paid a number of monthly instalments not far out on the west side in
his ambition was summoned to build a house on them
she had some slight gift of observation and that sense and so rich in every woman intuition
the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered
the floors were covered with matted hall laid with a thin rag carpet
then she walked and sang to it and tell hanson disturbed in his reaching came and took it
one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring in
and now he said walking and there there and and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice
he seemed to be thinking of something else
many began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself
you could get home easy to it isn't very far
she asked me for ink and paper which were upon the mantel in the dining room and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out through his card and wrote him
she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the trade but was too timid
anything was good enough so long as it paid say five dollars a week to begin with
a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
it was under such a suspicious circumstance is that she started out this morning to look for work
narrow board walks extend out passing here a house and their store and at far intervals eventful leaning on the open prairie
it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses and whose office is were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
these vast buildings and what were they done
he was in a fever state of mind owing to the light his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future
he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demanded or there would be trouble and it did not matter what he did
hurstwood walked the floor mentally ranging the chief points of his situation
he also thought of his managerial position
how would the papers talked about it
and many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this his brow moist
he could rage that satisfactorily for there would be glad to wait if necessary
he would see how things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her and they were going to meet as usual in
for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scant and nothing suspicious notice it
while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialized and with him no news was good news
so little did he consider grew that never once occurred to him to worry about his finding
he grew restless as he ruminated and then decide that perhaps it was nothing
she had not been able to get away this morn
he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back and he would look for it at once
after a time he gave up waiting and really head from madison carton
he went in and examined his letters but there is nothing from care in
fortunately there was nothing from his wife iron
at one thirty he went rector's for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him
his first impulse was to write but forward in reply and go to the devil
but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
then he sat down in his chair and and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
what would he do about that and the confounded wretch
later however his whole discretion assert its
something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle in
he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up
he rose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
the long griggs had begun pedestrians had turned up collar and trousers at the bottom
hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the instance of this
he put on his hat and looked round for his umbrella
he would have some derangement of this thing
he began to wish that had compromised in some way or other and that he had sent the money and perhaps he could do it up here in
he would go in and see anyhow and he would have no roundness
by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself and that he could see his way out
then he rang the bell and no answer
he rang again this time harder and still no answer in
when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quantity than ever
he could hardly realize how it had all come about
no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
he saw that in the excitement of recent events had not formulate a plan upon that score
he was getting some vague comfort of a good cigar and but it is no people for the hill which affected him
it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial and that at last he got an envelope and placed in it requested amount and slowly sealed it up
and then he called harry the boy of all work round the place
you take this to this address he said and handing him the awful opened and give it to missus hurstwood and yes sir said the boy in
he answered i guess not
the boy hastened away and the manager felt his musing
he was beaten for to night and might just as well make the best of it
she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
if he only had that letter back he wouldn't send it
for relief he rose and joined in the conversation with a few friends who were drinking
all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein inactive
in about an hour and three quarters the boy return
he fancied as he sat at his desk and that nothing could be done for a week or two and meanwhile he would have time to think
how about that now his pain at her failure to me or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subject
he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation and as well as to have her meet him
three o'clock came and four and five six and no letter in
the helpless manager and paced the floor and grimly and the gloom of defeat
he saw liz stirred ushered out the sabbath and and a thing done
all day the bar being closed he brooded alone shut out from home and from the excitement of his resort and from carrion and without the ability to alter his condition when i've done
it was the first sunday he had spent in his life
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angry at his perfidy in
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive

a loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast and better than a college bred in the latter not being a good shape and and trust me for the purpose
cut as many nice even slices may be required and rather more than one quarter inch in thickness and and toast them before a very bright fire without allowing the bread to blacken and which spoils the appearance and flavor of all toast

there was a trap that the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
when the trap disappear and took to me uncommonly like an open spring cart
in it i was deposited with my luggage
i did not know what he meant
i did not ask and i was beyond it
i was chilled to the bone wet and tired and hungry in
presently feet were advancing along the passage and several pairs it seemed and and light gleamed through the window over the door
a voice inquired and whose therein
the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
there was a rush of retreating feet and and expostulating voice and then darkness again and silence
who lives here the people man
i told the bell again
after a vast amount of and fastening the door was opened and and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in hand
mister christopher from london
i guess and positively guest
that's it and on your account in
from a cousin of yours has in that line
i never saw people like the swellings and for possessing relatives in all sorts of line
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin and got a prophet out of mary anne's engagement ring and but i handed over the amount
it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion spring is
there she owns a cottage and or it may be a pig stye for all i know
when she heard of my engagement with marianne and she wrote and suggested that we should spend their honeymoon in her cottage and or pigs and and that i should pay her rent for it
under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was imagined it was the accident of her christian name and which decided me to go in
i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of venturing in quest of one
we've lost the key of the cellar and and there's nothing out except water and and i don't think you'd care for that

of course there some people with whom and you can't be perfectly plain and but i shall be as plain as i can and there is a way in a manner of doing that kind of thing
hers has been prodigious
she has the knack of getting people to do and what she wishes and to give her and what she wants and which is little short of miraculous
i noticed that they are generally persons and have already tendered their offerings
the fact of having given mary anne a wedding present and seems to fill them with a feeling of red courses city which and to me is inexplicably
such is the selfishness of human nature
but why on that account and they should pity me and i altogether fail to understand
i had no solution in
i did not expect a princely entertainment
all night it had been blowing and raining

it is most delightful
it might just as well be someone else's wedding so unimportant is the part which i had set to play in it
for instance and look at their behaviour in the matter of the rich

and what inquired missus mc fierce and has marianne given you and her love in

i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romances dead at least in that circle of society in which the telling move
as it is and unless i am mistaken and some of the rending and will be on your side and they know it

she was a beautiful girl about seventeen years of age and not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty in
her complexion was not decided pink and but a soft rose tint not much deeper than that of trotzky
what is it coralie and she asked the woman
the queen gazed upon are friends with evident distrust
she smiled a little sadly at trotted seemed to approve of button bright hope and frank face and and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people

in that case said button bright and your entitled to the best there is one to pay for your trouble
if i liv'd as luxuriance lee as my people do and and servants and costly grounds and the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true
open doorway is best

still the rose tree stood out that there must be some great advantages in the gardener's care and for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations in the woods
then the wind's took another frolic round the garden and and made up to the large white lily and into whose refined ear and he whispered a doubt as to the necessity and or advantage of her thick powerful stem and being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
he really grieved to see it
we'd meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confucian reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden and
the mistress had returned and and the young lady was with her and and hurried at once to her front garden
in this position she remained and until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder in
i'm not thinking about the garden mamma and replied the young girl and without lifting up her face and we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
in those very early times there was a man named duke alien and and he was the son of reason
after jupiter had bound frumious on mount caucasus and set disease and cares into the world and men became very very wicked

one of the young fairies and overhearing herndon dancing she might work some mischief to the little baby and went and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall and so as to be able to have the last word and do any harm the old fairy might wish to work
the turn of the old fairy had now come and and she declared and while her head shook with malice and that the princess should pierce her hand with the spindle and die of the moon
it is true i cannot entirely and do what my elder has done
now fifteen years after the princess was born she was with the king and queen one of their castle and and as she was running about by herself and she came to a little chamber at the top of the tower and and there sat and honest old woman spinning and for she had never heard of the king's edict
she had no sooner taken up the spindle than being hasty and carelessly pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
he knew that she would not wake for a hundred years and
and said it was an enchanted castle and another that which is in there and but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre and which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time and for nobody could get him through the wood
in that lovely creature suppose that nature and had done so much for her and that the fame of her beauty extend throughout the world and had yet left her so weak and feeble and that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
indeed and not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestion
echoed the flowers and tremulously has and with a sort of fearful pleasure and the weighted his approach
and making a sort of heading circuit round the garden and he knocked over the convulsed old and tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily and loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings and broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground
and meanwhile and how fared it with flowers in
so that she were once more climbing up the friendly fur poled in
the honeysuckle escaped no better and and the carnation was ready to die of vexation and at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled hurt the dirt
before the day closed and the gardener came whistling from his farm work and to look over his pretty charge in
but for the sight that awaited him and he was not prepared at all and
no one but colan and the son of a meath and was ready for such a storm
the young prince at these words and felt himself on fire
the day is coming and said o meath and when jupiter and will send a flood to destroy mankind from the earth
but to clean and perils were very sad and for they knew that they were the only persons who were left alive in all the land

go on down the mountain and said mercury and as you go and cast the bones of your mother over your shoulders behind you and with these words and he leaped into the air and was seen no more

when at last they reached the plane they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings and all eager to serve them
scarcely had he come to the wood and when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket and opened on one side and the other to offer him a path
he entered a large for cord and stood still with amazement and all
but the faces of the men were rosy and and the goblets by them had a few drops of wind left
he entered the guard room and there the guard stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders and but they were sound asleep
he passed through one apartment after another and whether ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing
i have waited long for you in
they talked for four hours and not then said half that was in their heads to say
meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been awakened at the same moment as the princess and other now extremely hungry
the lady in waiting became very impatient and and at length announced the princess that they all waited for her
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendor and but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming
the violins no boys played old but excellent pieces of music and and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel castle

any rose painfully and the thrusting forward his skinny groping had formed by gouty swellings and suggested the effort of a morbid murder and summoning all his remaining strength for alas stab
very characteristics and perfectly typical

there is an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posture in
the famous terraced had never is life and raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice
the shadow of his evil gift clung to him and yet like the smell of a deadly grognon hold i love poisoned and empty now useless and ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time
i don't say that protested mycalessus gently
his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of his strange voice failed to write this time
the holes in the great settled down with a slight crash and mycalessus the hermit visions in the desert of a sedentary and got up impetuously
the disdainful out of comrade spins eclipse accentuated the negro type of his face
he paused then added with a modest firmness
i would call it candlestick that's what it is in

stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with and doubled up and down at once and as though it had been swift poison and sank limp lena sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door
he looked dubiously at his brother in law and but he did not ask him for information
mister verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to see
he stood still in the middle of the parlour and and looked into the kitchen in silence
he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen
he prowled round the table like unexcited animal in a cage
the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of their imposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plates for the night
her bare feet and as if poked through the bottom oven and adored sleeved calico sack and buttoned tightly at neck and wrists and felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband's face
there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police
it's like your horse suddenly falling tender you and in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain
the comparison occurred to mister verloc because he had sat astride very sorry horses in his time and had now the sensation of an incipient fall in
the prospect was as black as the windowpane against which he was leaning his forehead in
yes and not at all well
down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house and then died away and hurried and firm and as if the passer by had to pay out all eternity from gas lamp two gas lamp in the night without end and a drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom
that poor boy in a very exciting to night she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticking of the clock

don't you think that and if i had not been the optimist i am and i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat
a harsh laugh from comrade spent a tirade dead short in his sudden faltering of the town and the bewildered and steadiness of the apostles mildly exalted eyes
alexander spin got upon his threadbare blue serge suit under the low ceiling and took off the stiffness of long immobility and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look over stevie's shoulder in
he had been a prisoner himself
his own skin had sizzle and the red hot brandy murmured softly
you don't understand he began disdainful but stopped short and intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes and the face turned slowly towards him and with a blind stared and as if by it only by the sound
he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders
stevie unaccustomed to move about disregarded and had got up from the kitchen table tearing off his wrong to bed with him

these were but a few and for the first time in he opened the shop he took a commercial survey of its value
this survey was unfavourable
he took the cash box out of the ground and turning to leave the shop and became aware that he was still downstairs

mister verloc anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying
that boy he is too much of what is talked about him
if i had known they were coming to night i would have seen to it and that he went to bed at the same time my dear
he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating people's flesh and drinking blood and what's the good of talking like that
mister verloc was fully responsive now in
scarlet he growled savagely
he is not fit to hear what said he and he believes it all true
he knows no better and he gets into his passions over it
he glared at me and as if he didn't know who i was when i went downstairs
i wish he had never been to school missus verloc began again brusquely
he gets a red face poring over them
i would give a half penny for the whole lot
the other day he got hold of one and and there is a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing half off the ear of recruited nothing was done to him for the brute
he can't stand the notion of any cruelty

not having heard from captain benwick for some little time and randal thought desirable in sydney's intrusted to make inquiries at his club in
the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port and with no other explanation than that the cruise was over
this alternative in the captain's lands and terminating the voyage much earlier than his arrangements had contemplated and puzzled randal
randal weighted while in london on the chance that bennydeck i pay him a visit
he is staying at the hotel and to try their of sodom and and he finds that agrees with him
had her beauty fascinated him in
randal wrote to accept the invitation and determining to resent himself before the appointed hour and to question katharine privately and without giving her the advantage over him of repairing herself for the interview
after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
you distress me herbert more than words can say
he drank wine greedily in
whatever reviving effect might otherwise have produced on him and it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's question
randal he said and you know where sydney in
i will do neither the one nor the other in
you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature and always nicely dressed and always about the room and thinking so much of you and and so little of herself and had then to be left alone as i am left and out in the dark
i am alone do you hear that alone
i haven't courage enough to do it for myself
oh why did i engage that governess in
i'm afraid he said in
i tried it yesterday and hit set my brain is on fire and i'm feeling that glass i took just now
he paused and put his hand to his fever head
was his mind wandering into some other train of thought
you can't do it
let me hear what is first
i feel for you hurt he said warmly in
she shall have your message and all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way in
he mentioned the name of one of the old servants at mount morven and had attached himself to randal and after the break up of the family
on the next day but one and randal ranged his departure for side none so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner in
the number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published and randal brought it
after riding one or two of the political articles he tried at the columns specially devoted to and fashionable intelligence
randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him and he tried at the hotel and absently believing that and the charming widow and would prove to be a stranger
missus norman and her little daughter were striving with a friend and under expecting to return in good time for dinner in
missus presty was at home and she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel in
how nice of you to come so soon she began
she added looking at him suspiciously in
but you ought to know and that we are only half an hour behind you outside adam in the matter of noon
the reporters premature my good friend in
but if these newspaper people waiting to find out whether import is true or false and how much gossip would society get in its favorite newspaper in
you are to understand that katharine is a widow in
sit down said missus presty
you shall hear how my divorced daughter and and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandy seal and after you left us
you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her in
he was introduced to missus norman and and to missus norman's little girl and and we were all charmed with him
when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered and after having seen the beautiful wife and where the lucky husband
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty and that missus norman was a widow in
where stories have been printed and i do assure you were stories have been printing
before i consented to answer the child's inquiries and i came to an understanding with her mother
honestly in
after that and had her mother's authority for telling kitty and that she would never see her father again
she asked directly if her father was dead in
that will do missus presty nor defence is thoroughly worthy of your conduct and in all other respects
randal pass this over without notice it
a very wise decision she remarked
have you any message for captain bennydeck in
not at the hotel and just now done
it was a relief to randalls in the present state of catherine's relations to ward benedict returned to london without having seen his friend
good bye dear randal
arrived at the station and randal found that he must wait for the train
while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother an anxiety about sydney and the train from london came in
what are you doing here and he asked
you have been to the hotel he burst out and you have seen catharine
we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up and that it isn't it
not satisfied with gossip in private and the greedy public appetite devours gossip in printed and wants more of it than any one editor can supply it
supposing the reporter had been true in
in the meantime and after what missus presty had confessed and the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle and to a meeting between father and child
he had promised to do his best ward persuading catherine to grant sydney and interview
even the chance of successfully confiding hurt bennydeck's protection had lost something of its fair promise and since randal's visit to sidham
the results however what they might and randal could see but one plane course before him now
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty and even with an intimate friend
what a happy future could wait her and especially if she justified randal's past experience of all that was candid truthful in her character and than to become his friend's wife
shall i say that she may expect an early visit from you when i see her to morrow in
he had sydney's address in a postscript and despatched his letter that evening
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and and that the captain's proposals were still and waiting for catherine's replied

arctic beauty and desolation and with their blessings and dangers and all may be found here and to test the in durance and skill of adventurous climbers and but far better than climbing the mountain and is going round its warm fertile base and enjoying his bounty and like a beacon circling round a bank of flour
perhaps the profession of doing good may be full and but everybody should be kind at least to himself
go quietly and alone and no harm will befall you know
but it is far better to go afoot
a blank it will be enough to carry and or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether and as good for fires everywhere but
only a little food will be required

it is three or four miles long and terminate at an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet above sea level dim rain sprinkled ice cliffs sixty feet high
a long gray slope leading up to the glacier asim remarkably smooth and broken
most of the range of the glacier vanishes at once and in a porous rocks to appear in springs in the distant valley and and it is only in time of flood and that the channel carey's much water and then their several fine falls in the gorge and six hundred feet or more in height
tracing this wild changing channel gorge galore canyon and the sections will show mount fast and as a huge palace and containing the record layer upon layer of strangely contrast events in its fiery icy history
draining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit and you passed through a belt of juniper woods and called the cedars and to be broken at the foot of the steps
here you strike the old emigrant road and which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain
now tremor is the most noted stronghold of the sheep in the whole vast region
and large flocks dwell here from year to year and winter and summer and descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava bed to feed and but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags or mountain at every alarm
while travelling with a company of hunters and i saw about fifteen a flock
the mule deer are nearly as heavy
and their long spears and give them a very striking appearance
but neither the glorified woods on the one hand and nor the lake on the other and could at first hold the eye
then fell the gloaming and making everything still more for bidding and mysterious
and the darkness like death
at such time its height seems much less and has often crouching and weary and it were taking rest
dare crystal dance is responsive to the touch of the sun and and the current of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation and are ever in a vital world russian and though many feet in wings are fold and how many are stern
slight trace storms are likely to be encountered in a trip round the mountain and but one may easily find shelter beneath well thatched reasoned that shed there reigned like a roof
and then the shining of the wet trees is delightful and and esteem fragrance and and a burst of bird sang from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers and that have nests in the chaparral
thousand thousand voices are heard and but so finely blend did they seem a part of the night itself and and make a deep silence
and setting out from strawberry valley and by bearing off to the north west were a few miles you may see
in approaching it and its suspicious looking yellow spotted hood and watchful attitude and will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands and as if you were approaching a dangerous snake
it is lined with emerald valjean mosses and and shaded with alder and willow and thorny bushes and which gives it a fine set in
to three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the moat doc and held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack
the ducks less wary and kept the place is merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes and rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake
they are broad and rugged and cast a cloud like masses of down grinding ice and pouring forth streams of muddy water and has measures of the work they are doing and scattering the rocks beneath them and very unlike the long majestic glaciers of alaska and that river like go winding down the valley through the forest to the scene
thus the shaft river issues from a large lake like princess valley and and about two thirds of the volume of the cloud and gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain and a few miles back from its immediate base
should the volume of the stream where you strike it seem small and then you will know that you are above the spring is large and nearly equal to its volume at a confluence with the pit river and then you are below it and and in either case have only to fall the river up nor down until you come to it
and under certain conditions and you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock and at a distance of half a mile or even more and more you may not hear it until within a few rods
the vivid green of the bowlders beneath the water is very striking and and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam
simply me his pillow by a man who cheiron hazel and dogwood and alder and make a curious fringe and setting and and the forests of douglas spruce along the bank and are the finest i have ever seen in this affair
tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travel
and as the lifeblood of the landscape the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful histories
tracing the clouds to its highest springs and and over the divide to the fountains of fall river near fork and thence down that river to its conflict with the pit and on from there to the volcanic region about lessons beauty and through the big meadows among the sources of the feather river and down through forests of sugar pine and to the fertile plains of tycho and this is a glorious stern and impose no hardship
the scent of missus bute is an easy walk and and the view from the summit are extremely telling in
the lofty icy shaston towering high above all and seems but an hour's walk from you and the distance in their minds about sixty miles
the big meadows and near the foot of lasses beauty and a beautiful spacious basin and set in the heart of the richly forested mountains and scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by tone
the grey tides of country and once held to be boundless and inexhaustible and are being rapidly invaded overrun in every direction and and everything indestructible in them is being destroyed
harry landscape low and high seems doomed to be trampled and married
and yet strange to say their day's even here somewhat dull looking and when the mountain seems and communicative and sending out no appreciable invitation and as if not at home
with an education which ought to have been assured me an honorable standing in the world and with some intelligence and wit and good literary and scientific knowledge and and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society and i found myself at the age of twenty and the mean follower of a sublime art and in which if great talent is rightly admired and mediocrity is has rightly despised
did i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band and in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had no means of doctor of divinity and has an ecclesiastical and and as an officer in the army and and had welcome in the highest society
i felt that in my first profession and as i was not blest with the vocation necessary to it and i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and and i should have been despicable in my own estimation and even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders and for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscience
besides i was of opinion and that a man's profession whatever it might and ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his watson and the very poor pay of an officer and would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants and than those of officers in general
dear scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger
we would very often spent the whole night rambling about the city and inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes
did the same with physicians and whom we often set half dressed some nobleman and who was enjoying excellent helen
and whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower and we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ring the alarm bell and as if some fire had broken out and but that was not all and we always cut the bell rope and so that in the morning the church warden had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass
this is the amusing adventure which closed exploits
in every one of the seventy two parishes of the city of venice and there is a large public house called a magazine
yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches and in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent one
the weight of the magazine came to be paid and our chief gave him what was done and in joining silence under penalty of death
we took the three prisoners to a large boat in
where is my husband
never fear i shall see him again to morrow
my reader may imagine and whether he felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night and thanking us all with perfect good faith
two days afterwards are nocturnal orgy and began to be talked of
done went on to say that the two men had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had and an hour later and been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords and where they had spent an hour in drinking
there was no cowardly traitor amongst us and although we were all poor but fear had its affected are nocturnal ranks were not renewed
i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in a gondola and saying that he would leave me at my house in
i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whispered that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and and that he was dying
i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before had taught rosettes and such a forcible lesson and i inquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient bled again and thus improving the first bleeding proscribed by me
thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him everywhere he inquired
they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me and whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea and that he had tried to poison him
the physician who attended him was named tero and he thought and by some peculiar trade of reasoning that he could cure him and by applying a mercurial ointment the chest and to which no one raised any objection
delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again
he entreated me to tell him the truth
the extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
unwilling to her his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken and i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain and new miraculous which gave answers and also in numbers and too many questions i like to put in
i obeyed implicitly and met your excellence in
the three friends were astounded in
i declare myself quite willing and for it was necessary to brazen it out and after having ventured as far as i had done
he wrote the question and gave it to me and i read it and i could not understand the subject or the meaning of the word and but it did not matter and had given answer
if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i could not understand the answer
they all asked me how long it would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus in
not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish and although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days and if i communicated my science to any one and but i have no faith whatever in that prediction
they believed that through me and they possessed the philosopher stone and the universal panacea and the intercourse with all the elementary and heavily and infernal spirits and and had no doubt whatever that and thanked my sublime science and they could find out the secrets of very government in europe
but although believing fully in my oracles and they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil and done it suited their natural goodness and better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit
and they were not only good christians and faithful to the church and but even reeled voters and full of scruple in
as for the eucharist and ran substantiate shun the real presence and it was all no mystery to them and but palpable evidence and and yet they were not deserts
i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of poor morrel tonight tire to have declined intimate intercourse with them and for to have a deceived them
besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who and having nothing else to do and always trying to find out the calls a very moral phenomena they meet with and which their narrow intellect cannot understand
whoever you may be and i am indebted to you for my life
your apartment is ready and you may send your clothes you shall have a servant of god let your orders and my own table and ten sequins a month
you need not think of the future and think only and of enjoying yourself and take me and has your adviser in everything and that may happen to you and and everything you may wish to undertake and and you may be certain of always finding me and your friend
i threw myself at his feet and to assure him of my gratitude and and embraced him and calling him my father in
sir edward not wholly discouraged by the denial with which or a fourth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind reception and and was so often at the house of missus horton and that lord frederick's jealousy was excited and had the torture he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection
every time he be held the object of his passion and for he still continued his visits and though not so frequently as heretofore and he plead his cause with such hard and that miss woodley who was sometimes present and never compassionate could not resist wishing him success
yet did the watchful miss woodley oftentimes here a sigh escaped from her unknown to herself and till she was reminded of it and and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face
night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad and morning after morning it had been broken by the clamor of her return
i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home in
i thought miss milner and you gave me your word that you would pass this evening at home
yes indeed and and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not in
missus horton rose from her seat and moved the decanters and fruit round the table and stirred the fire and and came back to her seat again and before another word was uttered in
and at the usual hour mister dorriforth and his ward were summoned to feed and he entered with a countenance which evince the remains of anger and his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to be done it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand
miss woodley thought it her duty to be united and now the jingle of a teaspoon was like a deep toned bell was so quiet
missus horton to in this self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or alteration of any kind and felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable and
miss woodley did not recollect herself so and but was so in reality and in her peace and charity were instinctive virtue and accident could not increase them
he coughed and drank his tea and endeavored to talk but found it difficult and sometimes reddened and in this manner near two hours were passed away and when miss miller came into the room and not rest for a bald but as she had risen from dinan
or for threadneedle and seemed afraid of looking up and lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
and after a few minutes poisoned and some little embarrassment on the part of missus houghton and at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct and she asked miss milner and if she would now have any reason
pour forth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
in making this he had expected no success and though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal in
missus bazil was disposed to think that ladies of quality and among whom madame tea was entitled in her estimation to take rank and were seldom better than they ought to be and hand she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the ladies lover in
and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of husbands exertion and she would have taken pleasure in reading every word of the evidence and even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyer's
a distinct promise of a hundred pounds was made to him and if he would have the child ready to hand over to trevelyan and are villains rival in english
of course it said missus basil and
the eternal parrot has a right to his infant no doubt and that was bosley
he can't solemnity in
when a married woman has followers and and the husband don't go the wrong side of the postern door it proved again him that he do and they'll never let her have nothing to do with the children
i'll tell you what is she exclaimed missus basil and it's my belief as he ate quite right up here and missus basil touched her forehead
gregg mauled and what is it they wanted they don't know what they want
it's that as makes him and i won't say what in
but as for this here i'd been
trevelyan had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it is written down and was now with his prime minister and before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction in
does a mister samuel bazil lives here asked trevelyan
miss milner and you shall not leave the house this evening concern
and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door in
her hands fell motionless from that which she held and she appeared motionless herself and till missus horton and beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received and made her tears flowed as if her heart was breaking
it was not from any real calls of grief that she wept and but there was a magnetic quality it is which always attracted her in
do you think i would go and answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her ears and in contradiction to his will in
if you think so madam i see nothing that would prevent me now done
niece and i command you not to stir out of the room this evening
miss woodley obediently sat down and and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend and she never marked by one impertinent word and or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered
nor had this good woman's officious labors taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence and which as soon as the bustle she had made was over and returned in its full force
it is often ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome and sometimes unmannerly
or give the duties of my office and and believe that no one is half so much concerned it rob you of any degree of happiness and as i myself am
what he said and he looked with so much sincerity and that had she been burning with rage at his late behavior and she must have forgiven him and for the regret which he so forcibly expressed
she was going to replied and but found she could not and without accompanying her words with tears and therefore after the first attempt she decided
on this he rose from his chair and and going to her said and once more show your submission by obeying me a second time to done
keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future and as i find how strictly they are complied with it
in the last communication which he had received from lady milburgh and she had called him in terms that were for her severe and because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples
and now it had come to pass and that his sole remaining lied and mister samuel bazil and the ex police and was becoming weary of his service
at last he sent word to say and that he himself would be in england before the end of march and and would see that the majesty of the law should be vindicated in his favor
then bazil came forward and introduced his wife
but trevelyan was of a different opinion and he was discussed and revolted and most unreasonably and by the appearance of his ministers domestic derangement
bazil had always waited upon him with a decent coat and well brushed hat and his
it is very much easier for such men as mister basil and to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home in
perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes sarah villain
missus basil who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business and felt no anger at this and had her husband his best coat
bazil away from his own home and out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best hat in his and was aware that he commanded respect and he could carry himself accordingly
i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said trevelyan
if you would have gone to mister skinner suggested basil and
as he went about and his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he respected others and feeling that he himself was suspect it
and all were had ceased with him
he's up in town some minding of his parliamentary
i've watched as sharp as watching can go pretty near it
but if you ask me my opinion and wine of course they've been together somewhere
and basil as he said this smiled almost aloud
and he did go away and leaving bazil standing in the middle of a stone wall kin
when we took our seats at the breakfast table and it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this station
and instantly the absorbed all my attention and though i dared not give them a direct look and and continued to observe them only in the glass in
yes and a very respectable one
the lady is not the mother of the boys and but their manton
the boys belonged to the gentleman who is a widower
george nothin
the boy looked quite awake enough the father does not in
do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time
george in
have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide and
i know it sounds foolish and but the alternative is so improbable in
the boys look wide awake enough and but who can tell and i would sooner believe that day
the man was looking in from the corner behind and at the four persons were just discussing
i inquired of george with my eyes still on this furtive watcher
i took quite a fancy to him and wine
i am looking at him down
justin everyday detective but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of throne
yes he's mercurial in all his movements son
what does he want
i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
he wants me to stand ready to obey any summoned the police may send me
i emphasize complacently
he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was a detective gryce and a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these in
he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on and but evidently a great case still has its allurement for him
the trail he must be a very blind won for them to call him in
i wish we had not left so soon
he was late of course and but when he did appear i almost forgot you agreeing in my hurry and to ask him if he had seen the evening papers in
however a little later we had a comfortable chatted
it was one which gave me a small triumph over jordan
the suggestion he had laughed at and was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it
their greeting was cordially and the lies on the latter's face relaxed a little and has he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment and so much reliance had always been placed
this is very good of you he began glancing down at the age of detectives bundled up legged and gently pushing a chair towards him
it's the most inexplicable therein
but lose their absolutely none
that is and we have not been able to find any and perhaps you can
at least that is what we hope
it's a case in a thousand crisis
the old man's eyes shot fired and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor
she had no companion near her
no word no cried just collapse and sudden fall
in old days they would have said and struck by a bolt from heaven
what do you make of it to rights and
i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell in
a young fellow who had been hovering in the background and at once stepped forward
he was a plain face detective had spoken to jordan
this sweet water as they called him was i have since understood and one of his proteges had more or less of a front
and bent over the ground and studied the affair carefully
very well then your in a position to pioneer me
well well that's honest at all events in
but i am in no position to make promises and

i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed at my gun
we were right upon the yankee lines on the wilkinson turnpike
we were not twenty yards off from the yankees and they were pouring the hot shot and shell right into ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice ceased firing you are firing on your own many suffering you are firing on your own men
oakley color bearer of the fourth tennessee regiment ran right up in the midst of the yankee lines with his colours begging his men to follow in
the leaden hailstorm swept them off the field and they fell back and reformed
we were at that time at least a hundred yards in advance of the brigade and cheatham all the time calling upon the men to come on
and i saw and felt that he was not fighting for glory and but that was fighting for country because he loved that and he was willing to give his life for his country and and the success of are called
i thought had been torn from my shoulder in
as i went back to the field hospital and i overtook another man walking
dry before me i saw the long grass all bending toward a common centre and and i knew that it was an old well and that my comrade had fallen in
but how to get him out was the unsolved problem in
the poor fellow stayed in that well all night
he looked all round and thought that the coast was clear
i don't think his gun was loaded the and because we did not hear the ball whistle
we walked over this floating rigid and soon found ourselves on the tennessee side of tennessee river
we had before supper that night
and our repulsive beaten deepened and our air heart it throbbed with emotions of joy which seemed nearly akin to heaven and when we relieved the glad intelligence and of arnwood marched or the land of promise and of love
we were inured to privations and hardships and had been upon their march in every battle and research in every advance and retreat in ev'ry victory and every defeat
he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good bye and and to get his clothes and it was no go in
but after a while jim says a gentleman like an evil
you see and jim no dull
those old soldiers had long long ago forgotten about that old law of the log on past and but jim had treasured it up in his memory all these many years and and thought it would serve him now as it had no doubt frequently done in the past
the third day it is reported that the yankees had taken a position on the murphy's bore a pike
the regiment was sent to the attack and it is jim's regimen
he had not seen anything to shoot at but he blazed away he loaded and fired a second time when they were ordered to retreat
chapter seven the home coming in
cornelie nights talbot regard the white flag with feelings in which and triumph and sadness were mingled strangely
but the motions of harry and his comrades were and for a moment and those of victory only in
boats put both from the fort and the foreign
the smoke itself which had formed a vast cloud over the harbor forts and city and was now drifting out to sea and leaving all things sharply in the dazzling sunlight of a southern spring day
that white flag in those boats going out means that sumter is rich
but the negotiations were soon completed in
all the amenities were preserved between the captured garrisoned their captors
the great state of virginia and mother of presents went out of the union at last and and north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed her and but maryland kentuckian missouri still hung in the balance
lincoln had called for volunteers to put down a rebellion and but harry heard everywhere in charleston that the confederacy was now secure
the progress of president davis to the new capital and set in the very face of the foe and was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty
there is not a single note of gloom
europe which must have its cottonwood favor the success of the south
and extraordinary wave of emotion swept over the south and carrying and everybody with it
beauregard at once wrote in order
colonel kenton right wisely in
we need kentucky and i understand that a very little morn may bring the state to us and go with your father and i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here hand me you do as well up there
harry and feeling pride but not knowing it insulted and left the room going at once to mandolins and where he had left his baggage
he intended to leave early in the morning and but first he saw his friends and told them good bye
he gave his farewells in with deep and genuine regret
whether their manner was grave or frivolous he knew that these were good friends of his and he sincerely hope that he would meet them again
it was a different harry who start home late in april
for months had made great changes and he bore himself more like a man and his manner was much more considered and grave
he had seen great things and he had done his share of them
he gazed upon a word and full of responsibility and perils
but he looked back at charleston and dug the vault and the beautiful with real affection
it was almost buried now in flowers and foliage
he was going home after victory
he soon left charleston out of sight
he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state
people were cooler here and there were more prone to look at the two sides of a question
there too was unlike that of south carolina and there is a sharp tang to it
it wiped his blood as it blew down from the slopes and dressed in
it is afternoon when he reached the little station of wit and and left the train a tall sturdy boy and the superior of many a man in size strength and agility
there were never before such times in old kentucky
in cleaning them mountaineer's are a pin
he did not say the last as a boat and but merely as an assurance to the livery man he saw was anxious on his account in
if you got pistols and just to think once before you shoot said collins
harry thanked him through his saddle bags across the horse and powerful aid and and giving a final wave his hand to the sympathetic livery man and rode away
this was not the fashion of a year ago and when they exchanged a friendly word or two and but harry knew its course and now nobody could trust anybody else
until in the dark said joseph
he was in a mood for music was he not
he laid down his violin and seated himself where mary told him and in her father's arm chair by the fire
letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turn to call mary and she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor
the music was broken and and joseph and left alone with the dumb instruments
but in his hands and solitude and a violin were sure to marry in music
they sat down and and listened in silence
her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
a little longer and and she was compelled to yield and and the silent tears flowed freely
letty too was overcome and more than ever she had been by music
but he saw nothing that moved their and no signal light twinkled
one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy and washed himself well and put on clean clothes and and taking his violin set out for testbridge and mary was expecting him to tea
it was the afternoon of a holiday and dundee had closed in
was there ever and a happy man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpath
and he pressed his violin case to his heart and as if it were a living thing and that could know that he loved it
death was gone and and heaven was all
lest my here now and my god and less shall i be there then
when he reached the suburbs and the light of homers was shining through curtains of all colours in
just then and he was in no mood to think of the sorrows
let but a mood be strong enough and and sold and loathing itself in that moods with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world
it cried aloud and that eternity was very long and like a great palace and without a quiet room
nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician
and i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was in tree and that knew not itself
hast thou yet to learn and that the love of the human and his love and is divided his and but lower form of the part of the love of god
when the first man or woman nor child and your eve and gore right and then wilt thou no longer need that i tell thee and her garden his christ and would not be content with each other alone in the glories and even of the eternal riddle of and because they could create more love
and he that liveth not his brother and whom he had seen and how shall i love god who hath not seen
a sob and like a bird newborn burst from mary's bosom
that if manton had possessed him and gasping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it and when it ceased and he was not his own master
he started to conscious confucian only and neither knowing where he was nor what he did
how it happened he never could tell and but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano and then somehow stumbled and and all but felon
in the act of recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing and discordant cry and like the sound and of the ruin of the living world
his violin was broken and but his being and was made hold
his treasure taken and type of his self and and a woman given him instead
it's just like him and he murmured
you'll be over if you don't have a karenin
looks like a clump of bushes down there but i ain't sure and can you make it out in
yes agreed that does look like bushes
don't move round lie perfectly still roared the guide and are you hurt
and tumbles enough to knock the sets out of a full grown man in
i could not think of allowing any of my charge is to take so terrible risks hatton
no i am the light of the to her tad and
i am the one to go after all if any one has to and i'll go down mister thomas
after what seemed to them our sharp call from the depth reached therein
like quickly made fast the line to a tree
i see him called his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above it
he is so far to the right of me that i can reach him
lodged in the branches of opinion tree i think it is and but he doesn't answer me
while leaning over the brink was able to follow the boys whose by the aid of the remark of light made by the torch in his hand
but from the cautious movements of the light far below them the guide understood that the lad was at work of carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability
maybe you think he having some sort a picnic down there and lead line
now for two young gentleman directed the professor in
i am afraid to admit that i am hungry too
he buried his biscuit and a layer of jam and over which he spread thick coating of honey
president round i withdraw my courtesy i offer you my humble apologies
i reckon there are smiled the guide we are in the bare country now in
yes the country is full of caves
this announcement filled the boys with excitement
but i know and old settler who will endow his dog it is not doubt
galloping into camp the boy fetched his umbrella which he carried well out into the field and tossed away in
then bidding the boys ride up near the spot to watch him and he drew off some ten rods and wheeling and spurred his pony to ride
grasping the pommel with the left hand he appeared to dive head first or the ground
they saw his long hair almost brush the grass and one of his hands swept down and up and once more tad butler rose standing in his steps and uttering a cowboy yells he waved his sombrero on high done
the boys had with delight and that is all did say stacy brown
tis an inexperienced i turn
the first time he rode swiftly but leaning over to look at the hat as he passed holding to the pommel firmly with his left hand in
what's that for demanded ned wonderingly in
master tad is right decided the guide and gazing at the two boys approvingly in
shall we call a past life making unless haul away
supper having been finished the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chatted at which admonishing stacy to keep within his tent and not go bring trouble and the boys turned in for a sound
that too close to me i couldn't get explained chunky the boys roared
the pony did most of it admitted the lad i just gave him his head that's all there was to it
walter had gone out with the second guard and the others had gathered round the camp fire for their knightly story telling in
none of you will be fit for duty to morrow in
we've got a hard dry before a snare mamma's fit as a fiddle in
hump grunted curly adams
the cowboy did this very thick and but within an hour he found himself alone the other having turned in one by one
the lads found that a pair of blankets had been assigned to each of them with an ordinary wagon redoubled for a trial in
these they spread out on the ground using boots wrapped in a coat for pillows in
stacy brown proved the only trouble in the lot and declaring that he could not sleep a week on such a bed as that in
the horses of the outfit save those that were on my duty and two or three others had developed a habit of straying and had been turned loose early in the evening and for animals on the trail are seldom take down
spite of their hard couch in the pony riders slept soundly even professor zepplin himself never waking the whole night through
stacy grumbled and turned over and went to sleep again
i protest shouted the professor in
you have both of us at the bottom if i let you to take care of this end
be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up toward the guidance
are you ready and yes
he tilted his head to look up
the movement set his body swaying giddily from side to side
cautiously placing a hand against the rock to steady himself and tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious
slowly but steadily the slender line was paid out of intense silence on the part of the little group at the top of the canyon
poor thing answered the boy in
nor was his sense of security increased when in shifting his position the torch fell from his grasp the faggots scattering as they slipped down between the limbs of the tree and whirling in ever diminishing circles till finally he heard them clatter on the rocks below in
he no doubt would bring food of some kind with it
with a shout the boys dash pell mell to meet the pack train and handling in behind the slow moving burrows and heard them on a resistance and residing slap on the animal flanks
cold water is the most nourishing thing we touched last night
we did not it must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out laughed anne
and we've got a surprise for you announced stacy swelling with pride in
ram exclaimed chunky stretching his neck and hiding the dish longingly in
as yet they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying
the boys were now all anxiety to start and while the ponies after them and the rest were almost as full of life as were their owners
the little animals were becoming more sure footed everyday and ned said that before the trip was finished and jimmie and would be able to walk slack rope
an early start was made so that the party reached the promise table land shortly before ten o'clock in the fort
a temporary camp was quickly pitched
a great green field surrounded on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal and for their purpose
it was a beautiful race the little indian pony semi to enter thirdly into the spear of the contest and stretching themselves out their flanks and hind with heads on a level with their backs and fairly flew across the great pot of green
all agreed that superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him
why don't you move a pony
once more stacy approached the prayer his pony running welland and as he drew near it they saw him rise in the saddle just as tad butler had done a few minutes before it
at the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup he threw his body sharply to the right and reaching for that without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel in
as a result instead of stopping when he reached the hat the boy kept on going in
chapter four the first night in camp
even if i can sing i can be that
not on the range why not said the boy in
a loud laugh followed at the expense
you won't be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that i reckon
lumpy bates came running toward him not daring to call out for fear of breaking the captain
there he stumpy filled with indignation that any one should attempt to mount the pony from the right side
see brows left leg swung over the saddle
where are they asked the boy in
keep going and if you'll caldron plump into them was the cheering answer as we can men spurred their ponies stored camp and muttering their disapproval of taking along a bunch of boys on the cattle driver
almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail of the chuck wagon in
great pile of a great people
who is the angler this morning asked the form and glancing about his men
danglars wrangler answered books solidly
he's a fellow has all the time making trouble isn't he asked decently
oh no this kind of wrangler isn't laughed the foreman
he's a trouble you're not a trouble maker except for himself
doc tell the young gentleman what would become of you if you were to serve bad meal this outfit of cowpunchers
how asked tad
we had better stop the drive this morning in
when she said good night to be and and went to her chamber and over that where the loved parent and friends would fall asleep no more and she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb
at the time mary had noted nothing of these things and now she saw them all and as for the first time in my new detailed while slowly she went up the stairs and through the narrow ways and under the same in that trade alike about the new grave in the old house into which latter and for all the sails backed against the walls it found many a chink of entrance
when she opened the door of it the bright fire which he and desired had kindled there startled her and the room looked unnatural uncanny because it is cheerful in
she stood for a moment on the hearth and and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling sweeps of the winds making the house quiver and shake
this was her dream as nearly as he could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
she was a large company at a house where she had never been before and a beautiful house with a large garden behind it
it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and and through house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and in
but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
her only i was that she was lost
shall i pour out my soul into the aramis fumes from my own brain
thus was she bore away captive of her dead and neither willing or unwilling of life and death equally careless in
with that came a pack of intense pain
she herself would have been a poem and lyric in white gowned and green scarf and coming to him through the long grass under the blossoms boughs
her hands should have been full of bluebells dundee should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
you see that she knew exactly how trust is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheap weekly journals
she had to the full it allowed of her reading in her environment the literary sense
she said how frightfully cold it in
and yesterday i had a letter from her and she seems to expect to think and and i thought i to tell you darling in
a shock of unbelievable relief tingled through her and that was all and what was it compared with her fears
what opinion would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul and if an insult like this failed to shock her deeply in
following the tinkle of relief came a sharp sickening pang of jealousy and mortification these inspired him
i don't wonder you were afraid to tell he began you don't love me you never love me and i was an idiot believe you did
those four words wounded her more than all the rest
couldn't help it and then how can i ever trusted in
dulcet strains of the ill treating ill fated intermeddled had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous peril organ that had so gaily executed that and along with another two days of its repertory unto the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite and and a growing delight of the two babies next door
the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles and the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table and for now the late summer dusk was falling and that organ please heaven and made for the measure of the day's appointed torture
then there was silence then aside and and a sound of light moving feet on the gravel in
and again he listened with a quiet pleasure in
never at any act seemed so impossible
there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house and again she hesitated in
then she turned toward the quarter indicating and disappeared round the laurel bush in
look here he said this is all nonsense you know you are tired out and there's something wrong what is it
to drink this and then tell me perhaps i can help you
he hurriedly cut cake and pressed upon him
at the end of it she was in a place of to day
curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say din
do you think i'm not sorry now done
she entered and the servants soft footed and silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and and restoring order and as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow and no one he did her
she was lost and lost utterly and with an eternal loss
she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go and nowhere she wanted to go and had not thought to tell her what question to ask if she met a living soul in
a living soul there could be none to meet
she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him and he was there and she knew him
he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
i know it and there is no waking in
the old time was but a thick cream and this is true because more shadowy in
she only wished for made and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers and the dim desolate whether in
the setting of the scene seems to her all important
it is bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
he had been late and had offered no excuse no explanation
but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
a keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jackets
her hands and feet working with cold in
she would have shared his sorrow and showed herself half wife an angel from heaven in this dark hour
no doubts only painful for both of us
i don't think a decent man could do such things was pulling on her gloves and go home and gloat over it all in
he stood up suddenly do you mean it and
do you really going to throw me over for a thing like this
and strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door it was a very good exit
at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy therein
he checked the silly impulse
so he elicited and to south africa london he never came home covered with metals and glory which was rather his ideal and to the few simple words of explanation that would have made all straight and and repaid her and him for all the pass
he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happen
it's only that your poor why that's nothing i'm port and she laughed
her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
told me to stay on at the hotel and and i did and then one night when i was at the theatre i made a horrid french thing we got in paris and packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went
she said again you are kind in
well then i went into lodgings and that wicked woman had left me one street suited to day they turned me out because my money was all gone
let me think he said oh how glad i am that happen to come this way done
i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then i shall give you my lacquey you can let yourself in and stay the night here and there is no one in her
i'll catch the night train and bring my mother up to morrow then we will see what can be done
you see pas so very rich and at home they expect me to and to get acquainted with dukes and things and she stopped
it wasn't i he said that said the girl smiling but that's so anyhow and and then she sighed
all the same he had irrelevant leave you shall have the latch key
you are kind and she said for the third time and reached her hand to him and he did not kiss it then only took it in his hand felt how small and cold it was and then it is taken away in
the lady and the guitar certainly passed the night hillview viglund but when his mother very angry and very frightened came up with him at about noon the house looked just as usual and and no one was there but the charwoman

and there is an old story about this which i shall tell you
oh what shall we do for him
and on the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and had looked miserable and as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy
she was indeed a clever bird
she popped into her new house and sat there comfortably and peering out through the window slits with her sharp little eyes
and she saw all the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly
then all the other birds chirped eagerly and yes yes and let us ask her to teach us
so in a great company they came fluttering and hopping and twittering up to the elm tree where mother magpie nestle comfortably in her new house
so wise mother magpie and dear mother magpie they cried and teach us how to build artists like your and for it is growing night and we are tired and sleepy
the magpie said she would teach them and if they would be a patient diligent and obedient class of little birds
and where each bird perched and there was to build its nest
she began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nets as they should be made
and some of the birds her attentive and careful and soon saw how it was done and darted nice homes for them cell
i thought that was the way to begin
certainly of course screamed the jackdaws

for she had only the foundation laid criss cross and as the magpie had shown him
a person would think that after the family had lived so long in a place and all the neighbours would be fond of them and yet it is not so in

they always eat plain food and plenty of and and they never hate between meals
you would think that with six legs apiece and rejoiceth in each leg and they might walk quite fast yet and they never did
they did not breathe it into their mouths nor gilds and but took it in through some openings in the back of their body

this had got away
fernand meditate over his good fortune
in moments of deep feeling and alike sudden bursts of prosperity has in dark hours and man must be alone
it requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune and as well as to encounter difficulty and danger and disgrace
this violent and triumphant revolution in his prospects in his fortunes was hardly yet completely comprehended by our friend ferdinand ride and and when he had left a note for the generous smear of blood whose slumbers he would not disturbed at this early and even with good news he strolled along up charles street and and to the park and in one of those wild and joyous reveries in which we brood overcoming listened and create a thousand glorious consequence is

it was indeed her handwriting

where lower lips anyway answered the women
their upper lips are so small they don't matter
they knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fish is and bugs and they swam away as they could
and indeed of the lower lip of a dragon fly child might well frighten people and for it is fastened on a long jointed arms like thickened and as pincers on it with which it catches and holds
but sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him and and then it pincers catch hold of and he does this when he's hungry
cared and whose afraid and answered he none
here comes the snapping turtle
sure enough and there he came through the shallow water and his wet back shell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight
and restless with impending joy and he sauntered to the rigid and leaned over the balustrade and gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacant
how many incidents and how many characters and how many feelings flitted over his memory of a sweet and bitter experience did he not chuckled
four and twenty hours ago and he deemed himself the most miserable and for lord of human beings and now all the blessings of the world seemed showered at his feet
the most gifted individuals in the land emulated each other in proving which entertained for him the most sincere affection
he not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessed and yet with all his faults which with him were but the consequences and of his fiery youth and ferdinand had been faithful to henrietta
his constancy to her was now rewarded
as for his friends and the future must prove his gratitude to them
it was indeed dance into a volcano in
and now all had ended so happily
was it not all a dream of his own creation while his had been fixed in abstraction and on that brightened flowing river in
he might be enchanted but that was the talisman
in the present unsettled the hopeful state of affairs and ferdinand would not go home
exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world the pangs of love and a throb of ambition and the wear and tear of played and the discriminating darn the conspiring club and the rattle in hell and and found himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of lebanon and inferior only in extent and to the chestnut forests of anatole

grant was only a few miles away and but although the commander in chief he knew nothing of the hardest fought battle of the civil war until it was over
my own regiment was in the dance
drugged was fearful outnumbered
there were no breast works yet that one little brigade of hamilton's division stood there in the open and and ripple salt after assault
not balaklava laura helmets such fighting it was the rule to the death
no battery in the hole for war and law so many men in so short a time
a daring revel was shot down and bayonets and clear behind the line of company and where he had broken through to seize the flag of my regiment
that night the enemy slipped away and leaving hundreds and hundreds of his dead and wounded on the field in
with a few lanterns and are men then went about and tried to gather up the wounded were left till morning
and it was not a question of who was dead or wounded but he was not
fifteen officers of little half regiment were dead or wounded in
i remained awake all night and talking with a comrade who shared my blanket with me poor jimmy in
he served the war and only to be murdered later on a plantation in mississippi
when morning came the firing opened and for all that day the battle raged fiercely at the left and center left we getting the worst of it to none
that evening and order came for us and hamilton's division to assault the enemy's left flank at midnight
and the same quiet moonlight and only six hundred yards away from us and also laid the victorious red alarm in
once in the night i slipped away from the bivouac and hurried to the old irish mingoes hotel to see a lieutenant of my company and had been shot through the grass
i could not help my friend
go back to the regiment he said smiling and all will be needed
my friend with many others and was being carried out to die elsewhere
i hastened back to the line
a crowd of rebels we had seen divided itself into three columns
a perfect blaze of close range musket removed them down like grass
they lay in heaps of does and uneven close up to the works
that night i stood guard under an oak tree on the battlefield and among the and buried dead
indeed and we of the rank and file had little confidence in grant in those days
rosecrans protest and it is in vain
it required months and great events to make grant the hero of the army which he afterward became
for some reason and the dead at hatchie bridge were not buried in
a week after the battle and my brother rode by their cavalry expedition had made the horrible discovery that hogs were eating up the bodies of the dead he rose and that was worn
long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters
everywhere and at a certain day of a certain month and he went away to a distant city intellect money on account
how do you know master i am older and wiser than you are and i know that their many evils which may come upon you
when it was evening and he led his band into a nearby treated and in his disguise approached the merchant's house he knocked at the door
have pity upon a poor unfortunate one and called out
let me entered i pray you to pass the night under your roof
it surely a terrible storm outside said the merchant eldest daughter and as the winds rattled the tides of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows
he is told as well as poor she said in
if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar and it is not for you to oppose it
but we should not forget your promise to father cried the youngest daughter
however and in spite of all she could say and the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar
it is a fearful eye to send away a beggar and said the eldest sister while they were eating in
while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples and which the girls were to eat for deserted and sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
the two eldest temples and but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away
she did not turn and he knew that the sleeping power had thoroughly done its work
then she heard him go down the stairway and and and but the heavy doors which led into the store in
it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chief
perhaps we can out her yet cried another in
the merchant's daughter at first i did not answer but as he kept on calling to her and she finally asked him what it was that he want it
i promise you i will do you no harm in
you shall not come into my father's house
pass the charm out to me then said the robber
when she returned and his hand was sticking through the hole in the door in
the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air
they tried in vain to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish
he had little enough to break bite and once when there was a great famine in the land he could hardly procure and he and his daily bread and and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife and what will become of us
how can we feed your children when we have no more than we can here cells
oh you simpleton and then we must all four die of hunger and you had better plan the coffins forest
but she left him no peace till he consented and saying and ah but i shall miss the poor children
and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up and put on his coat and and and bring the back door went out
father said hansel and i am looking at my white cats sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye and
but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat and but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon that
but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought of it were better to share the last crust with children
early in the morning stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and and gave them each a slice of bread and which was still smaller than the former peace
we are going into the forest to hew wood and and in the evening when we are ready and we will come and fetch you again
hansel thought the roof taste very nice and and so he tore off a great peace and while gretel broke a large round pane out of the window and and sat down quite contentedly
come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and and so saying he took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
the old woman behaved very kindly to them but in reality she was a wicked old witch who waylaid children and built the bread house in order to entice them in as soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked them and ate them and made a great festival of the nation
then she took up hansel with her rough handed and shut him up in a little cage with latticed door and although he screamed loudly and it was of no use
gretel began to cry but it was all useless for the old which made her does she want it
gretel she cried in a passion get some water quickly be handsome fat or lean and this morning i will kill and cook him
dear good god help us our sheep
creep in said the witch and see if it is not enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when grettel got in and to shut up the of and and and let her bake so that she might meet her as well as an
c and i could even get in myself
and she got up and put her head into the oven
and now and as there was nothing to fear and they went back to the witch's house where in every corner casks full of pearls and precious stones
then they began to run and and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
had been a clerk in the banking house and was transported for embezzlement though by some grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained
when the muster bell rang and a gang broke up and rufus dawes on his silent way to his spirit said observed a notable change of custom in the disposition of the new convict
i'm not to go in there says the ex bank clerk crawling back in dismay from the cloud of foul faces which lord upon him and
what is he more than anybody else said the wretched himself he hugs his misery close
bowed on the next morning and mister north who amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop and had a habit of prowling about the prison an official hours and was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory
a prisoner refractory or reverence said the watchman
want to come out and mister dorrit
clad and ghastly pale bleeding and with his woollen shirt torn and his blue eyes wide open with terror and was clinging to the bars
and beat on the bars with white and setting an
i order you sir north cried and indignant
very sorry your reverence but and your reverence knows that i dare do such a thing
oh you ministers of christ and wolves in sheep's clothing you shall be judge for this
let him out cried nora again stamping his foot
there is more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough to lie quiet
you can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered
impertinent young beggar said burgess
do him good and curse him
it's hard for such young ones in
have you ever been in that and that place i was in last night masculine
what does he care and karen
if you fall and we must fall over you and then your done for
he had hardly uttered the words when the boy flung himself beneath the log
hold on to me miss nancy said the giant and i'm big enough to carry dublin
colonel and kept steadily on for the river in
just as he reached it however and the figure of mister north rose from behind a pile of stone
clun jumped for the jetty and missed his footing and fell into the arms of the chaplain
oh mister nor missus clinton and why did you stop me
stop that fifty lashes croak
at last fellow you had ought to have been tied up himself
i won't have my men knocked up with flogging these rascals
very good order says rock
captain frere says that the scenery is delightful
abandoned indeed by god and man almost
in the valley of the shadow of death he is with us
you have not been long in the colony mister
if you please said mike and gravely in
pray help yourself to wine

i was quartered with him aunt sarah island
so he's a friend of yours in
i had the pleasure of meeting him in society
he's just married you know and as he said burgess
the devil he is and i heard something about it too
yes and one to leave the colony without seeing it says burgess it's worth seeing
in fact the ringleader john rex gave me his confession and and i sent the bishop
a great rascal put in or in
well now said meek and with asperity and i don't agree with you
he seems to me to be truly penitence his offenses and misguided but not hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything and i hope he is said north
there's no fear of him said burgess cheerily and if he grows uproar and we'll soon give him a touch of the cat
i suppose severity is necessary returned meek and wrote to my ears the flogging sounds a little distasteful in
i have these attacks at times
the reverend meek and his clerical brother with horror and the reverend mean was not accustomed to clergyman who wore black neckties and smoked clay pipe and chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers
so they went on to the veranda and looked down upon the lights of the prison and and listened to the sea lapping the shore
by and by and a short figure smoking a short and came up out of the dark and proved to be doctor mac away and had been prevented from attending the dinner and by reason of an accident to the constable at norfolk baden which had claimed his professional attention
dead said doctor mc lane
delighted to see you mister mc undone
but michael was tired and want to get home
our road lay together doctor
before the two clergyman had got half way down the steep path that led from the commandant house to the flat on which the cottages of the doctor and chaplain were built and michael way rejoined them
another flogging to morrow said he grumbling lean
who is he going to flog now
you don't mean to say he's going to falkland
perhaps you'll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned mac away and drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature
mister me and expressed some alarm a but doctor mac away reassured him
we can't do anything without evidence complained
i shall find my portmanteau in my room you said nelson
he sleeps at the back and forth hurried off
and impulsive gentleman said meek and to make a wounded as the sound of mister north's footsteps died away in the distance
michael and shook his head seriously
he has the strange outfit at times
unless it's a cancer in the stomach and i don't know what it can be and dance in the stomach
doctor we'll have are crosses have we not in
how delightful the grass smelling
good night sir and i hope you will be comfortable
i'll teach my prisoners to attempt suicide in
that smack always business in
then don't interfere with me sir

then captain burgess cried or pale face flushing and i tell you the boys blood will be on your head in
i am a minister of god sir and i forbid you to commit this crime in
an impertinent sir burst out burgess
your dismissed officer of the governments in
this of course was mere bravado on the part of the commandant
north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence and but the insult stung him like that of a whip
oh mister north out he said and and go down to the barracks and and tell broken that colony is to have a hundred lashes to morrow
i'll show you master here my good sir none
this is murderous
the government may go too and and you too roared burgess and get out
they shall not flock that boy he said in
i'll repeat this to the government
i wish i hadn't taken that brandy he said and fool that i am and
oh god give me strength and made me and help me
o lord look down upon me in
he mixed a teaspoon of this in a pan of water and drank it
it relieved him for a while
it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been four days gathering for it
i must have a tea spoonful he said and to allay the craving
twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven by a power stronger than his will
he smelt the approach of the spirit
that at all times debasing and at this particular time it was infamous and that of ice and unworthy of any man is doubly sinful in a man of education and and a minister of god and in vain
in the midst of his arguments and he found himself at the cupboard the bottle at his lips and in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
go and do you hear in
but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot and the veins of the throat swelled and his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy and nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry done
and the cries issued from his paws and if we may thus speak and cry frightful in its silence
even he rushed toward the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative
avignon and unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws stored those who have loved the people for whom we more and extended his hand towards the young man
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs and exclamations and rare in
what do you mean sir and
oh you raise sir exclaimed villefort's in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken and i rave

dante looked upon moral with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and and thus fixed his attention

the old man's eyes remained fixed on the door in
miss morland yes

but can he understand you yes
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice and give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall for ever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
my father has revealed the culprit's name and my father for revenge as much as you do yet evenly conjure you as i do to keep the secret do not father
moral suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him in
the old man made a sign in the affirmative

but he stopped on the landing and he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber in

lotty was near the bed and pale and motionless and silent as the corpse
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead and he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just and closed the lips
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbe who lives next door to shall i call on him as i passed
ah indeed said villefort to be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman and here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please and you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child's room and do you wish to see him in
i only wished to be alone and you will excuse me will you not

poetry not being an exact science liberality of rendering is altogether secondary to this chiefly

a word should be said he of the title of dante is autobiography
this has induced the editor of the deed a novelty to explain the title has meaning her life
thereafter this sonnet readin me desired to write down in verse for other things touching my condition and which things seem to me and that i had not yet made manifest
which things being thus there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known and they having been with me advertise in my trouble and were met together for the pleasure of gentle company
but when i still spoke not one of them who before had been talking with another against me by my name saying and to what end love hast thou this lady and seeing that thou canst not support her presence
and now that it hath pleased her to deny me this and love my master of his great goodness hath placed all my big attitude there where i hope will not fail me
then those ladies began to talk closely together and and as i have seen snowfall among the reigned and so was their talk mingled with sides in
and i declare that when i speak thereof and love sheds such perfect sweetness over me and that if my courage failed not certainly to him my listener's must be all resigned
whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love to issue thence flame and which through their eyes who them look on them and pierced the hearts deep chamber everyone

this second part is divided into two for in the wind and speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love and in the second i speak of the south which is the end of love
and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened and which called out to me and thou shalt surely die and after the which other terrible and unknown appearance is said unto me and thou art dead
and so strong was my fancy and that i wept again in very truth and said with my true voice and so excellent soul how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee in
whereby the other ladies her about the room and becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of those that she made a who indeed was of my very near kindred and led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying asleep no longer and be not disquieted
