you will find me continually speaking of four men and titian and whole band turned and tintoret and in almost the same terms in

this at once compel you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative and that represents beautiful things and the clearest wakened but not under existing conditions and and that and in fact and you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures
that styles restraint or severe does not mean that is also thrown us
in all early gothic are indeed you'll find failure of this kind and especially distortion and rigidity and which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic carton
a large letter contains indeed and entirely feeble and ill drawn figures and that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand and it is not characteristic of gothic and or any other school
but observed you can only do this on one condition and that of striving also to create in reality and the beauty which you seek in imagination

how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that through its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
god has a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished and had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parents for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally blest soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless boots attire however simple and always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
this outward mutability indicated had not more than fairly express the various properties of her in her life
hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing herself from the spiritual world and her bodily framed from its material her
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition and but later in the day of earthly existence and might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
hester prynne nevertheless and the loving mother of this one child and ran little risk of airing on the side of undue severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes and eagerly sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant mortality that was committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline were addressed to her mind or heart a little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicably perverse and sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits and that hester could not help questioning at such moments and whether pearl was a human child
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elphin the light which she invariably began and to snatch her to her bosom the close pressure and earnest kisses and not so much from overflowing loved as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters and the mother felt like one who has evoked spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjurations and has failed to win the master word that should control this new and in comprehensible intelligence
pearl was aboard outcast of the infant i'll world
her lord and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance

hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had finished and embroider to his order and which were to be or on some gratification of state and for though the chances of a popular election had called this form ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial man just received
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time and to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity the affairs of the settlement
at that epoch of pretty simplicity however and matters of a slight public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare hester and her child and were strangely mixed up with the deliberation of legislators had acts of state
the period was hardly if at all her earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig and not only paused fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature

the mother herself as if the egg nominee were so deeply scorched into her brained that all her conception assumed its form had carefully thought out the similitude and lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create analogy and between the objects of her affections and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth the pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us limit them
but pearl who was dauntless child and after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gesture and suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted to with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless because the hearts of the fugitives to quake within

they approached the door which was of an arched formed flanked on each side by narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticed windows and the wooden shutters to closed over them at night
lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond servants a free born englishman but now a seven year slaves

on the table in token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester corporal peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of priestcraft of hell

when they were outside of simply latch of the door and started up the path
no one would disturb their little house and even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the mountains from the country of the guns and the path divide
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician and whom he had never seen but he was their nearest neighbors in
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon hunk know joe sat on a fallen tree trunk and and at the last of the bread which the old moleskin had placed in his pocket
then they started on again and and two hours later came in sight and of the house of doctor pipt
he knocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman and dressed all in blue and opened it and and greeted the visitors with a smile
i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home in
we have come from afar lonely place than this and a lonely place
and you must be o unlucky she did
no had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
we are traveling replied old joe and and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
the woman seemed thoughtful and
at one end stood a great fireplace and in which a blue logs was blazing with a blue flame and and over the fire hung four kettles in a row and all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
it takes me several years to make this magic power but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done and you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use of it for a purpose of her own

i think i must show you my patchwork girl and said margaret and laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant and to help me with the housework and and to camille and wash the dishes
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt and because the patches and colors are so mixed up
when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl and for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty and as the glass cat and for such a dreadful mixture of colours as would discourage her from trying to be hanged dignified as the blue mountains are
and at the emerald city where are princesses lives green is a popular colouring
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and and threw open the door
no no examined this curious contrivance with wonder
margaret had first made the girls for from the patchwork quilt and and then she had dressed with a patchwork skirt and and an apron with pockets in it a using the same game material throughout
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her in
there was a round yard and hung down on her neck in several neat braden
gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
no i forgot all about the brain exclaimed the woman
well that may be true agreed margaret but the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become and independent and high and mighty and and feel above her work
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles in
i think that will do she continued and for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
she ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire in
their contents had all boiled away and leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder in
very carefully the magician removed this power and placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the power of life and but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and and came back to the cupboard and
oh became a bit uneasy at the door had already put quite a lot of the cleverness power in the dish and but he dared not interfered and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with the pepper box top and so that the powder might be sprinkled on any objects through the small holes in

they asserted with confidence and and almost with exultation and that the past logical succession was interrupted and that all the bishops of europe and asia were infecting by the contagion of guilt and schism and and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers and who alone had reserved inviolate and the integrity and of their faith and discipline

he was in the midst of that when you return caused him to make a very good very hurried and since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that had been there
mister solmes was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
holmes held out a small chip with the letter ended a space of good afternoon scene
watson have always done human justice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was in some trace of it my crew upon the polished surface no i see nothing
has home through the curtain was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency in
homes turned away and stooped suddenly hallo what is this
holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him he rushed into your bedroom it
i understand you to say that there three students whose this stair and are in the habit of passing your door and yes there
and they are all in for this examination
one hardly like to throw suspicion where there are no proof
let us see the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left very poor he is hard working and industrial he will do well
the top floor belongs to myles mc clellan
i dare not go so far as that one of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
if you look at these papers on the table
how came you to leave the key in the door
any one in the room could get out yes sir
i really don't think he knew much about mister him
only for a minute or so in
oh i would not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them and no sir
it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his line
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said holmes as we knocked chris door
of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocked and but none the less his conduct was very and courteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious in
that is very important
you don't seem to realize the position
to morrow was the examination
i cannot allow the examination to be held in one of the papers have been tampered with the situation must be faced in
it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
i will take the black clay with me and also the pencil cutting good bye
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the window
the flower fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why bannister the servant what's his name in that
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
oh good my dear watson
i think so you have formed a conclusion
yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
look at that he held out his hand
on the palm were three little pyramids of black and be killed
and once more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the fact public and allowing the culprit valuable scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and ran tow'rds holmes with too eager hands outstretched and thank heaven that you have come in
you know him and i think so
if this matter is not become public we must give ourselves certain powers dissolve ourselves into a small private court march
no sir no certainly not
there was no answer
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested and with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther shore
just closed the door said holmes
we want to know mister girl kissed her you an honorable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
for a moment mixed with upraised hand tried to control his riding feature in
come come said holmes kindly is human terror had at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you no injustice
he could examine the papers in his own office
the indian i also thought nothing
when i approached room i examined the window
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of a side table
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you wear with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed or dora he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the table
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escaped
have i told the truth mister ghost
i have a letter here mister solmes which i wrote to you early this morning the middle of a restless night
it will be clear to you from what i have said and that only you could have let this young man out since you left in the room and must have lock the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you should know
if mister solmes saw them the game was up
in the debate between the senior societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been and not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
john tailor had supported her through college was interesting in cotton
better go he had counsel sententious lean
might learn something useful down there
but john and there is no society and just elementary work
been looking up to his county in
find some crust well then big plantations and wrote two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
some others too and big cotton county
you ought to know john and mighty negroes i scarcely see much of people in my own class
at any rate i say go in
here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration and was to her at times unbearable
we want a glance at the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropy and reforms in
so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day and as she walked alone and up the lane back of the garden and then slowly down to the bottom
cotton and she paused
she had almost forgotten that it is here within touch and sight
the glimmering of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her and stretching away to the northward
there might be a bit of poetry here and there but and most of this place was such desperate roads
her regard shift it to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather relieved
miss taylor did not know much about cotton but and at least one more remarked seem called foreign
don't know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor and literary born in cotton and hand oh well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go in
i suppose that's too early for them and then came the explosion
girls don't grow on the tops of vines buttoned on the ground on the roots like them and his that's done
the golden fleece and the silver fleecy harkened in
sometime you tell me please and won't you know
now for one little half hour and she had been a woman talking to a boy and know and not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation unjust things and one thing cotton
the honorable charles smith miss sarah's brother was walking swiftly uptown from mister easterly wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances and assured fact and was slain before the senate
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman and she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in turn
has she awaited her guest she surveyed the table with both satisfaction disquiet to do for her social functions were few and to night there were she checked them off on her fingers and sir james morton the rich english manufacture and lady right and mister and missus van der luyden and mister harry cross swell and his sister and john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith and whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey and a selection of guessed that had been determined unknown to the hostess and by the meeting of cotton interest earlier in the day
missus ray had met summers before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to a poor negroes and a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister crasweller express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
do you believe in some education and asked mary tailor
i believe in the train of people to their high capacity the englishman he heartily seconded him
but a cross swell had significantly and capacity differs enormously between racing
the van der pools were sure of this said the englishman distance in india became quite eloquent and missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admitted the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individually to be submit to the sharp scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races and it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
positively heroic and address well avoiding his sisters
but we are not a exactly welcome
mary tailor however related the tale of or to missus rays privateer
fortunately and said mister van der luyden authors and others are driving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver fleeced his and morals must be ruined
it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasies the hopes dreams built round it
ah the swamp the cruel swamp
the revelation of his love light and bright and slowly till it flame like a sunrise over him and left him in burning and in
he panted to know if she to adorn and cared not or cared and knew not
she was so strange and human creature in
the world was water veiled in mist
then a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and sticky and no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth seemed
where was the use of imagining
the lagoon had been level with the dikes a week ago and run down
perhaps she too might be there waiting and weeping in
he started at the thought and he hurried forth sadly
he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down and the garden
he stood a moment bewildered and then turned and rushed upon the island and a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and and beneath the mighty mass of olive green and thick all wet and willow sweden
the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to burst open
for a long moment he paused a stupid gaped and with utter amazement and then leaned dismally against a tree
he gazed about perplexed on it
here lay the reading of the riddle and with infinite were contained some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek and into which the former had drained by long and crooked ways and thus allowing it to empty directly in
he sat down weak bewildered and and one thought was uppermost sarah
the years of the days of her dying were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sick room or laid on the little white bed
the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping round her and she had struggled in dumb speechless terror again some mighty grasping that strove for her life and with hard and creeping fingers and but now at last and weakly and she opened her eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at snubbed tree
she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl round her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp and
she had been born within its borders and within its borders she hid and groaned and done within its borders she had met her love
she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island unloaded the cotton lay before him
the chair was empty but he knew
he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but simply made
the paris planted like that at the crystal palace and was a temporary exhibit
and plant was less temporary and but not permanence applying before it was torn out and no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings and in the vicinity of holborn diet
there and messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now stand in the yard and secured much useful data for the work in new york and of which the story and has just been told
the dynamo electric machine though small and was robust and for under all the varying speeds of water power and had the vicissitudes of the plant which it belonged and it continued inactive use until eighteen ninety nine and seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure and wreck current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way and of delivering electrical energy to the consumers and medicine has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
why if we erect stationed at the falls and it is a great economy to get up to the city
and there seems no good reason for believing that will change
a broad as the prairie and free in thought as the winds that swept them and he is hideous erratically opposed to loose sand wasteful methods and two plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy and the contraction of space and the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and hand that reason was often urged against it seriously
it could not be used for electro plating or deposition nor could it charge storage battery and all of which are easily and within the ability of the dark current
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburban a group of dwellings on the outskirts and a remote country residence and or a farmhouse and the alternating current in all elements of its danger was and is ideal
edison was intolerant of champagne donati and had nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope and too stupid and galvanometer
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and had more exactly governed regulating than those available for his dynamo and lambton medicine realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
mister allison was a leader far ahead of the time
he obtained the desired speed and loaded with the friction brake and also regulator of speed and but wait for an indicator to verify
then again there was no no way to brotherton engine for continuous running and and mister edison informed that and as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port and so an engine for his purpose is must produce light at all times
edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york and on the multiple oxen and covered by his fever and main invention and which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors and has against a straight to wire system and threw out of the tree kind
he soon for all that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success and not alone for the larger territory opening and but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the edison system and under the strenuous competition that was already springing up and was enormously improved by the introduction of the three were summoned and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
it was specially suited for a trial plan also and in the early days when a child of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
the street conductor were of the overhead whole line construction and under installed by the construction company that had been organized by madison to build and equip central station
meanwhile and he had called upon me to make report of the three were some unknown in england has the hopkinson and both doctor john hopkinson and and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the medicine construction departed and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started
but the plant ran and hand it was the first three were stationed in this country
they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of medicine and but they remain in practically as good condition and has when installed in eighteen eighty three
the camp installed outside the customers premisses and or in circuit for public streets lighting and burned so many hours nightly and so many knights in the month and hand was paid for at that rate and subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through oxen
edison held that the electricity sold a must be measured just like glass or waters and he proceeded to develop a meeting
there was infinite skepticism round him on the subject and hand while other inventors were also giving the subject there thought and the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible has electricity and that could not be seen forward and had only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point use and could not be brought to curate registration
hence the madison electric meter is no longer you'd and despite its excellent qualities
the principle employed in the edison electric peter and his that which exemplified the power of electricity to decompose chemical substance
associated with this simple form of apparatus under various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and hand immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
the standard medicine meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meat room of the central station company for examination and another set being substitute
in december eighteen eighty eight and mister w j jenks reading an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers and on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with me and then more generally in use than any other
the others and having been in operation too short time to show definite results and although they also went quickly to the dividend basis
in this connection and it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies and in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the affected that the edison meter was cure a hand that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand nights and a hand that the best financial results were invariably secure and ministration selling current by me
a meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and had probably up to the close of the century
he weighed had regained the meter plate and had pursued harry line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felt he was up against a hand that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was solved
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station and than in the commercial part
we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquids
stirred and august fifteenth and the sea and broken all round no land in sight
the horizon seems extremely distant
all my danger and and suffering and were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him and but now that i am well his nature has resumed its way
you seem anxious my uncle i said and seeing him continually with his glass to his side and anxious
one might be and with less reason than now done
i am not complaining that the rate is slow and but that the sea is so wide
we're losing time and done the fact is and have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
he called this upon and and a long voyage taking a little sail
i shuddered as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
i saw that the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures and thirty feet in length
i suppose professor liedenbrock and was of my opinion to an uneven shared my fear for after having examined the pick and his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
to day and august eighteen
during his watch i slept
two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain pitch down again and at a distance of twenty fathom in
there's a whale a whale cried the professor
the atmosphere is charged with vapors and pervaded with electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing water
the electric light can scarcely penetrate the denser and which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the element is about to be waged
there is heavy the sea and his calm
from time to time a fleet of mist and with yet some gleaming light left upon it and dropped down upon the dense for grain and lose itself in the opaque and and impenetrable mass
the atmosphere has evidently charged sir charged with electricity
win never lose but to acquire increase strength and the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir and of fearful and windy gust and rushing storms
there's a heavy storm coming on i cried and pointing towards the horizon
those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
at noon the violence of the storm readable
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
the waves rise above her head in
they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
he nodded his consent
the fireballs half of it white half has ruined and the size of a ten inch shell and moved slowly about the raft and but revolving on its own acts with astonishing velocity and has if whipped round by the force of a whirlwind
here comes there it glides and now it is up the ragged stump of the mass and then it lightly leaps on the provision bag and descends with a light bounded unjust skim the powder magazine and horrible
we shall be blown up and but no and the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside and its approach his hands and who fixes his blue eyes upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle and who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air and it enters the throat it fills the lungs
we suffer stifling pain
and heard the directions will look
poor alice
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other and he came trotting along in a great hurry and muttering to himself as he came and hold the duchess the duchess
no i won't he be savage and if i've kept her waiting
alice took up the fan and gloves and has the hall was very hot and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking and dear dear how queer everything is to day in
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
light was out of the question and the reptiles roads they wheeled round the little raft and with a rapidity greater than that of express train
on the mast already i see the light played a voluminous telford and the outstretched sail catch is not a breath of wind and and hangs like a sheet of lead
i take this is my answer and and leave the professor and to bite his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteen
nothing new western range and discretion
but there seemed no reason to fear
the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truly this is of infinite within
it must be as wide as the mediterranean nor the atlantic and why not
these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep
to monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes and are to reptiles of the primitive world
i can distinguish the eye of the hideous source and glowing and like a red hot cold and and as large as a man's head
its jaws enormous and and according to naturalist and it is hard with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other and with the greatest animosity
suddenly a nicholas source and oppress the source and disappear below and leaving the whirlpool varying in the water
as for this the source and has he returned to his submarine cabin
the rings became lost in the distance
the weather and if we may you the turn will change before long
but if we have now ceased to advance and wide yet leave that sluice in which at the first shock of a tempest and make capsize us in a moment
that will be the safest and no no never
the piled up vapors condensed into water and and there and put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation and of the mist and raise itself into a whirlwind
monsters knighton
from the under surface of the clouds and their continual emissions of lurid light and electric matters in a continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of their indeed to be stated with moisture and for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figures obliterate
is the atmospheric conditions and having once reached this destined to become fine linen
the raft bears on still to the southeast
and yesterday and things went on just as usual in
i wonder if i have been changed in the night
i almost think i can remember feeling a little differently
i'll try if i know all the things you to know
i shall never get twenty at that rate
her cheerfully he seems to bring her neatly spread his claws and unwelcome little fish in with gently smiling jaws
no i've made up my mind about it and if i'm able i'll sit down here in
it will be no use their putting their heads down and sing and come up again dear run
i am so very tired of being all alone here in
and i declare and it's too bad that it in
i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
i shall be punished for it now and i suppose by being ground in my own dear
that will be a queer thing for to be sure in
i am very tired of swimming about here a mouse
cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and and she felt certain it must be really offended it
we won't talk about her any more and if you'd rather not and we indeed
here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics and rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance and had taken her into his good grace for all time
and every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied and was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
then dear said missus one you must be kinder to her than ever and think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
oh she's always at the piano and she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
at this the bundle opened suddenly and and out popped phronsie
but polly couldn't speak and and if jasper had taught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool fronds and all in
there jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the sight of jasper's face
don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost and such a time as i had to get her here too
heard her mother ever let her go
she asked impulsively and i didn't believe you could persuade her father
i didn't have any fears if i worked it rightly and said the old gentleman complacently
he cried and high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that had to burst out into a series of short happy fits of laughter and that occupied quite a space of time
she gathered up her rain
please wait for me mary and mixed
i never see whose side over here
her round you've got since you came home and i wish i had an athlete to my orchard
i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not
they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
there was something individual about the great farm and a most unusual grimness and care for day
just smell the wild roses and they are always spicy after rain
we never had so many of them in hearing
i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them to him
i suppose that's the wet season to then in
its exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass asked
are you splashed a look at the spider webs all over the grass
in a few moments he heard the chairs dropping smartly into the pale and and he began to swing his side with that long heave and stroke that few american boys ever learn
mary picked cherries and sang softly to herself and stripping and glittering ranch after another and shivering when she caught a shower of rain drops on her neck and hair
asked bronzy with her little face close to polly zone
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill and stood tall osage orange hedges of their glossy green marking the yellow fields
and he made his way slowly down toward the cherry tree
sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divine together he threw out his arm and brought back with a jerk so unlike a table cloth
it would serve you all right if she walked off with karl
i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
omean
surely you are not thinking of going off there
mary's face fell under his brooding gaze
i'm sure alexander hoped you will stay on here and she murmured
did not stand round and come on
i want to be doing something on my own account
now you'll stay cried van say polly won't you
oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw land but how did you make mammy let her come in
isn't he splendid cried jasper in intense pride swelling up and father knew how to do it
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs and i won't and only and i can't thank you
asked bronzy intense interest slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper's side
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
oh no jasper i must go by my very own
it is sixteen year since john burke's and died
his wife now lies beside him and and the white cat that marked their graves gleams across the wheat
from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkered board marked off in squares of wheat and cord light and dark and darkened light
from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farmhouse and the gilded whether veins on the big red bars wink at each other across the ground and ground and yellow fields
the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree and with a handsome head and stormy grades deeply set and a serious round
that's not much of a job for an athlete and here i've been to town and back
alexandria to sleep in
anyone thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divided and that the farmer was a woman alexandra burgesses
there is even a white roe of bee hives in the orchard under a walnut tree
frank red english slowly and the more he read about this divorce hungry he grew
mary sighed
a brisk wind had come up and was driving buffy white clouds across the sky
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
that invitation decided him
oh but i'm glad to get this place mode
that summer the raids had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than a bottle and his man could do to keep up with the cordon the orchard was a neglected wilderness
i know all of them but no indians are
if i feel that way i feel that way
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet in spirit and long ivory coloured berries tipped with a faint pink like white corals that fall to the ground and he did all summer through
he dropped a handle into her lap
yes don't you
oh ever so much only he seemed a kind of staggered and school teacher
when she used to tell me about him and i always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him
get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
i wish you were so restless and in one gets so worked up over me she said sadly
thank you and he returned shortly
and you never use to be cross to me
i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly and that's what you miss green
but me and if i understand and then all are good times over we can never do nice things together any more
and anyhow there's nothing to understand
that won't last it will go away and things will be just as they do it
i pray for you and but that's not the same as if you prayed or self
i can't prayed to have the things i want he said slowly and and i won't pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
then all are good times are over
he passes abruptly a person to ideas and numbers and a dream ideas and number two persons from the heavens to man and from astronomy to physiology and he confused or rather and not distinguish subject and objects and first and final calls and hand is dreaming of geometrical figures and lost in the fullest sense
the influence which the timorous has exercised upon posterity and is due partly to a misunderstanding
in the supposed depths of this dialogue and the neo platonists found him in connection with the jewish and christian scriptures and and out of them and they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
they were absorbed theology and under the dominion of his name and why that which was truly great and truly characteristic in his effort to realised connect abstractions and was not understood by them at all
there is no danger of the modern commentators and the timorous and falling into the absurdity of the noble latin it
in the present day and we are well aware and that the ancient philosophers to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary his thought
the fancies of the new planet and are only interesting to us and because they exhibit a phase of the human mind and which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and and is not wholly extinct in our own day
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and hand in spirit and they are opposed to him
we do not know how plato would have ranged his own dialogues and or whether the thought of a raging any of em besides to trilogy which he has expressly connecting and was ever present to his mind
the dialogues primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term and the heavenly bodies and with man only has one among the animals
but he had not as yet defined and this intermediate territory and which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt and that there was as great and piety in drinking theories of physics first and in the order of knowledge and has in placing the body for the soul
with her practice he acknowledges the perpetual flux and like a negress and he asserts the predominance of mind and although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing and like the pith angry and as he supposes the mystery of the world to be cut in number
many and if not all the elements of the aristocratic philosophy and are included in the women
it is probable and that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world and was differently seized by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remained and but they have become types in nature forms of men and animals birds fish is
style and plenty of the women and differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic violin
but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument and which he exists in the fields or simply a
nothing can exceed the beauty or heart of introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner and
but in the rest of the work and the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could write in what island but not in another and and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena and
and hence and we find the same sort of clumsiness and in the timorous of plato and which characterizes the philosophical poem lucretia
there is a want of loaded and often a defect of rhythm and the meaning is sometimes you're and and there is a greater use of position and more of repetition than occurs in plato's hurry writing
plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art

i wish to recur again but will take two or three interviews before the stiffness and the estrangement of this long separation will wear away
my eyes fill with tears when i contrast the bliss of such a state and brightened by hopes of the future and with a melancholy state i now inserted that i never felt true contrition and wandering in thought and deed and longing for holiness which i shall never never obtained and smitten at times to the heart and with the conviction that ghastly calvinistic doctrines are true and dark and in short by the very shadows of spiritual death

the christmas holidays came and she and anne returned to the parsonage and hand to that happy home circle and in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people the shrivelled up more or less
indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result
she was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell and it is dark and no one saw her mischance until after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by done
unfortunately the fracture cannot be still six o'clock the next morning and has no sir john was to be heard before that time and and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state
however remembering what you told me and me that you had commended the matter to hire decision than are and and that is all to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be and i hold it my duty and to yield also had to be silent and may be all for the best
after this disappointment i never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me in

toby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as charlotte expressed it and one of the family
he refused at first to listen to the careful advice and it was repugnant to his liberal nature
this decision was communicated to the girls in
toby had tended them in their childhood and then another should tend her in her infirmity and age
at tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three
she had another weight on her mind this christmas
but anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sister with jealous vigilance of some wild creature and that change is her very nature if danger threatens her young
stung by anxiety for the little sister and he upbraided miss w or fancied indifferent to hand state of health
till her heart had received a shock in the perception of as delicacy and and all these holidays she watched over her with longing fond anxiety and which is so full of sudden pangs of fear
i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time in
but already at a point in economic revolution are anticipating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
such consumption asphalt women is merely incidental to their work and it is a means to their continued labor and and not consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life
with the further advance in culture this too may change into simple custom of a more less rigorous cracked and but whatever be the theoretical base of the distinction which is maintained and whether it be taboo or larger conventionality and the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
under the taboo certain victuals and more particularly uncertain beverages not strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants and therefore ten in their turn to become a terrific and as being a mock at the second remove and of the spirits of those who are able to afford the indulgence
it have happened that the name for certain deceased conditions of the body rising from such knowledge has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense and is consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and and is therefore a mark of the master
with many qualifications and with more qualification sat the patriarchal tradition has gradually weaken and the general rule is felt to be bright and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their master
the abjection of course itself that expenditure on women stress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule and but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
the custom of festive gatherings probably rejuvenated motives of convivial piety and religion and these motives are also present in the later development and but they do not continue to be the sole motives
there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and great it
this differentiation offered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
many of these belated gentleman of leisure and are at the same time lest men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to berated as vicarious consumer
so many of them however and as make up a retainer and hangers on of the patron and may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
many of these again and all so many of the other aristocracy of less degree and have it attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive groups of vicarious consumer and in the person of their wives and children and their servants retainers sexton
the wearing of uniforms liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude and real or ostensible done
wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes and the free and the smile and the noble and the ignoble done
but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
so and those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class noble and such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and and the like and in short to those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employment
whenever has in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting and it easily acquire a reflective don character
the liver becomes obnoxious to nearly all who required to wear it
in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide in
the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife for the chief wife and and as would be expected in the late development of the institution and when the number of persons by whom these duties customarily performed gradually arrows and the wife remains the last
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached and where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
in the communities of the west and culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are and they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic or of wasted effort
the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly dozen but with a still lower descent into the level of indigence and along the margin of the slums and the man and presently also the children virtually ceased to consumes valuable goods for appearance and and a woman remain virtually the soul exponent of the household pecuniary decency
very much of a scholar and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the least pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
there is no class no country that has yielded subjectively before the pressure of physical wants and as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
he will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of lightning the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
it is also noticeable that the solubility of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it has an element of decency and is at its best in those portions of the community the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is great it
consumption becomes a large element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
among the country population its place to some extent taken by saving son home comfort so through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
the result is a great nobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than any other equally well defined and considerable body of workman and
and the simple test of effectiveness for advertising and we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods and dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme and leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold drank very much above wasteful consumption of goods and both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency and during the course i peaceable culture
the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and and on whatever is of human use
a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resort to make believe and many and instruct polite observances and social duties of a ceremonious nature are developed and many organizations are found with some specious objects of amelioration embodied in their official style and title and there is much coming and going and and a deal of talk and to the end that the talk is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effect of economic value of their traffic
a salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated in
throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure and the good source service for human life and runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually men the consumers good fame and it must be an expenditure of superfluity in
as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries and tone of deprecation
the use of the word waist as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the end sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
in strict curacy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
an article may be useful and wasteful both and and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has sir round it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements and though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild resources
the dews were suffered to exhaled and the sun had dispersed the mists and and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance and became more deliberate and watchful
he often stopped to examine the trees and nor did he crossed a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity and the velocity and and the color of its waters
distrusting his own judgment and his appeals to the opinion of pink cheeks were frequent and earnest
yet here we and within a short range of the screws and and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
let us retrace our steps and and examined as we go and with keener eyes in
chichikov had caught the look and and motioning with his hand and he bade him speak
the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bit in

if a rock or rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common and severed the links of the clue they followed and the truth of the scout recover them at a distance and and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
extinguished brands were lying round a spring and the halls of a deer were scattered about the place and and the trees bore evident marks of having been roused by the horse is in
the circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
the examination however resulted in no discovery
the whole party crowd to the spot where uncle pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist delusion

notwithstanding the high resolution of her kind he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur in
in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects under intently engaged in devising means to counteract watchful no suspicion on the part of his enemies and that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
in other words and while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam's ass to speak and he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear sinking and and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of iniquity organs in
there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman and was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied in
can these things be returned david being more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
come come returned hawkeye and cursing his honest countenance and the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion and you may see the skin which and if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones and has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heavens and thus and have not bestowed and now and let us to business
the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
die greatly more that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and have sought a goodly him can you leave me to him
the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating and though i greatly fear your presence would rather increased than mitigate his unhappy fortune
the lodge in which case was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
for five the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of anxious weary but close observer of the manner of their captive
delivered in a strong tone of assent and announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy and so long hated and and so much feared
they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjure to enter
but the bare instead of obeying and maintained the sea it had taken and growled in
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage to continue david and improving the hit he received and they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety and scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy and being tenanted solely by the captives and and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
dick's occupied a distant corner in reclining attitude and being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful with us
the scout and had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed and thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door and they count six and the singer is as good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstrip the deer
dukes had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way and now recalled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement and continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
so anxious you had better take the leader and i will put on the skin again and trust cunning for want of speed
well and what can be done by main courage nor must be done by sir convention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instruction
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust has greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so dressed and attack on his manhood and but there none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord and even in the greatest strait
if you not then knocked on the head your being an imposture will protect you and and you then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed in
so choose for yourself and to make a rush or tarry here in
bravely and generously has he battle in my behalf and done this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent as long as may be and and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to mind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scalp and as i trust and believe they will not and depend on it and anxious and i will not forget the deed but revenges becomes true warriors and trusty friend in
hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him and i am unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
and then heaving a heavy sigh and probably among the last he ever grew in pining for a condition had so long abandoned and he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood and though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend and i do believe your senses not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and and keeping eternity before the eyes so much depends on the natural gifts and a force of temptation
the delaware dog he said and leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid in
with her hands here his groans in
the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasion to delay for the next instant a a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
ducks cast his second step forth in his own beautiful proportion
it is a very fine old place of red brick and softened by a pale and powder he likened and which had dispersed itself with happy irregularity and so as to bring the red brick and into terms of friendly companionship and with the limestone ornaments rounding the three gables and the windows and and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and and the door i think and is like the gate and it is never opened it
for it is a solid heavy handsome adored and and must once have been in the habit of shooting with the sonorous bank and behind the liveried lackeys and had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and and bear boarded floor and at the far end and leases of wool stacked up and in the middle of the floor and some empty your bag
and what through the left hand window in
several closed horses and a million and a spinning wheel and and an old box wide open and stuffed full of colored rag
at the edge of this box there lies a great wood and all done which so far as mutilations concerned and bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and and especially in the total loss of its own
the history of the house is plain now in
but there is always a strong sense of life and when the sun is brilliant after rain and and now he is pouring down his burden and making sparkles among the wet straw london lighting up harry patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the ground and into a mirror and for the yellow bill ducks and who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink and with as much body in it as possible

do not suppose however and that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance and she was a good looking woman and not more than eight and thirty and of fair complexion and sandy haired and well shaped and lightfoot done
the family likeness between her and and her niece idle morris and with the contrast between hyrcanus and and die as sir traffic gentleness of expression and might have served a painter has an excellent suggestion and for martha and mary
her tongue was not less can hide and and whenever a damsel came within earshot and seemed to take up hand and finish lectures beryl organ takes up a tune and precisely at the point and where it had left off
the fact that watching day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and and i consequently and missus poyser's should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
to all appearance and molly had got through her after dinner workmen and exemplary manner and had cleaned herself with great dispatch and and now came to ask submissively and if she should sit down to her spinning until milking time
spinning indeed
i never knew equals for closed in
who to crumble or i should like to know
comb the wolf or the widow's indeed
that's what you like to be doing it
that's the way with you and that the road you'd like to go down headlong to ruin
mister oakley's indeed in
you are and for sitting down to your work a little while after it's time to put by
me and my aunt i told and be put down to warm in
cold is it my darling and bless your sweet face
she's going to put the ironing things weighed in
me and i should like to go into the barn to tommy to see the with god
no no no tea at her feet wet and said missus poyser's and carrying away her iron
did ever anybody see alike and screamed missus poyser's and running towards the table and when he had fallen on the blue stream
t however and had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat tow'rds the dairy and with a sort of waddling round and and an amount of fat and on the nape of her neck and which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white sucking pig
and she was very fond of you to aunt rachel
i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
when she had that business and i was only eleven years old she used to say and you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel and if i'm taken from you and for she has a kind hearted and i'm sure i've found it so
and there in the house as i could well spare you and for i got lots of shooting and table loathing and howling as it made up
but not more than once in the bible and done said diana in
and ran to and you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work in their families in
we can all be servants of god and wherever lot cast and but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits for it and calls to it
i can no more help spending my life and trying to do what i can for the souls of others and than you could help running and if you heard little toddy crying at the other end of the house and the voice would go to your heart and you would think the dear child was in trouble or danger and and you couldn't rest without running to help and comfort her
i've strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children and from anything i have done
i couldn't reach without detection
direction
i had a calm and patience with you in
by this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and got down from their horses and it is plain they meant to come in
said mister berwin and with his stately cordiality in
no sir don't mention it said missus poison
i delight in your kitchen
poised is not at home is seen
said captain de thorn and seating himself where he could see along the shore passage and to the open drawer
no sir he isn't and he's gone to rest to see mister west the fact about the woollen
but their father in a barn sir if he'd be of any use
no thank you and i'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
i must come another day and see your husband and i want to have a consultation with him about horses in
for if he anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
oh sir said missus poyser's rather alarmed and you wouldn't like it at all
but you know more about that than i do sir
i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
i know his farms in better order than any other within ten miles of us and and as for the kitchen he added smiling and i don't believe there is one in the kingdom to beat it
by the bye and i've never seen your dairy and i must see you dear missus poyser's
this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk pans and and would just his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
no i've no doubt in capital order
we want you to help us published some leading work of luther for the general american marked will you do it
the conditions that will be permitted to make luther talk american stream like him and so to speak and because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church and actually truth unless we make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task and proved a most difficult and and and at times became oppressive
it was written in latin
the work had to be condensed
a word should now be said about the origin of luther commentary undulation
much later when a friend of his was preparing edition of all his latin work he remarked to his home circle and if i had my way about they would reach publish only those of my books and which had doctrine my galatians for instance
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther progressed his students and in the course of galatians and and roar repaired the manuscript for a printer
dear resents like no other of luther writings the central thought of christianity and the justification of the inner for the sake of christ's merit alone
but the essence of luther lecture is therein
the lord has given us power to teach and to hear and let him also give us the power to serve and to do unlooked
the word of god shall stand for ever
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
they said to the galatians and you have no right to think highly of paul in
he was the last turned to christ in
paul came later and is beneath us
and indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time in
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few thin heretics and would disown his entire church
against these boasting false apostles and paul boldly defends his appetite local authority and minister
as the ambassador of a government is honored his office and and not for private person and so the minister of christ should exalt his office and in order to gain authority among men
paul take a pride in his minister and not his own praise but the praise of god
paul an apostle and not of men to settle in
either he calls ministers through the agency of men and he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
paul declares that the false apostles were called sent neither by men and nor by man
the most they could claims that they were sent by others
he mentioned the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
but all is not to be taken lightly
for a person to possess knowledge is not enough
it spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
i did not then realise the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because it's so sophistry instead of certainty and and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride and it is wholly pride
and god the father who raised him from the dead
the clause seem superfluous on first sight
these rivers of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrection christ won the victory over loss in flesh and were levelled death and held very evil
certain
and all the brethren which are with me in
and they should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles
although the brethren with me not apostles like myself and yet they are all of one mind with me and think and right and teach as i do
they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate and they go where the christians are
why do they not evade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless prince's and bishops and doctors and as we have done by the help of god
we look for that reward which hath not seen a door heard and neither have entered into the heart of man
not all the galatians had become perverted
these means cannot be contaminating
they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church and even that christ reigns there
so much for the title of the pistol and now follows the creaking of the apostle and overthrown
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
the terms of grace and peace common terms with paul and and on our pretty well understood
the greeting of the apostles refreshing in
grace involves the remission of sins and peace and and happy conscience
the world brands this pernicious doctrine
experience proves this
however and the grace and peace of god in
men should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to save from god the father in
to do so as to god altogether because god becomes intolerable and when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infant majesty
he came down to earth lived among men and suffered was crucified and then he died and standing clearly before us so that hearts and eyes may fastened upon him
and embraced him and and forget about the nature of god
did not christ himself say and i am the way and the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but i mean
when you are you about the nature of god apart from the question of justification and you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ has been appointed by the father as a divine teacher
at the same time paul confirms or creed and that christ is very god
and that christ is very good and is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine power is equally with the father and as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
and another score these words and for they are full of comfort force or conscience
to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god and he alone can create these blessings and the angel cannot
otherwise paul should have written and grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
the areas took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels and because by him and god created heaven and earth
mohammed also speaks highly of christ
paul stick to his theme
he never lose sight of the purpose of his epistle
not gold or silver or passion lambs and saw an angel but himself and what fortune
not for a crowd nor a kingdom and your goodness but forces
how may we obtain remission of sins in
all answers and the man his name jesus christ and and the son of god gave himself forces
since christ was given forces it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by their own efforts
this sentence also defines sins as great and so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god and indicates this
the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words and he gave himself forces in
but we are careless and we make light of sin
we think that by some little work or merit we can't dismiss him
this passage then and bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin and the conception that sin is a small matter and easily taken care of by good works and that we must prevent present god with a good conscience and that must feel no sin and before we may feel that christ was given forces
this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance and comfort of the words and for our sins and is lost upon them
on the other hand and we are not regard them as so terrible that we must despair
to celebrate the rival of her son and sylvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively and she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republican letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an inn
in order to please her and i spoke to her of the abbey caught and and i had occasion to quote two lines of that profound dry
and am accredited me with a patronizing air from pronunciation of the words several which means divided saying that ought to be pronounced cure and and she had that i ought to be very glad to have heard so much on the first day of my rival in paris and telling me that would be an important in my life
her face was an enigma for it inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
sylvia was the adoration and and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her and especially of the plays of marvelled for without her and his comedies would never have gone to posterity
sylvia did not think that her good conduct was merit and for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self love compelled her to be so and and she never exhibiting any pride and or assume any superiority towards her theatrical sisters and although satisfied to shine by their talent for their beauty and they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
two years before her death i saw her perform the character of marianne and the comedy of mare of odin and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was
she was honorably buried in the church of saint severe and without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing that i christian intolerance of the clergy in general and said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and the earth was a common mother of all human beings has jesus christ had been the savior of all mankind
you will forgive me dear if i have made you attend funerals sylvia ten years before her death and believe me i have no intention of performing miracles you make us so your self with the ideal and that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia died
i never had any family in
i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
i shall call a spree
you do me a great honor in
here and go and get me change for lucy and i have it
at your service sin
mad am questioned besides can answer your queries
i see a quantity of chairs for her at the rate of a new and men reading the newspaper under the shade of the tree and girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company and waiters who were rapidly going up and down and narrow staircase hidden the foliage
i sit down at a small table and a waiter comes immediately to enquire my wishes
i told him to give me some coffee it is good
then turning towards me he says that looked like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian and he begins to speak to me of the court the city of the theatres and and and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
i thank him and and take my leave
i addressed him in italian and answers very italy and but his way of speaking makes me smile and tell him why
my remark please him but i soon proved to him that it is not the right way to speed however perfect may have been the language of that chain
see a crowd in one corner of the garden and everybody standing still and looking up

and all these honest persons waiting their turn to get their snuff box in
it is sold everywhere and but for the last three weeks nobody will you any stuff but that's old set cat
is it better than anywhere else
but how did she managed to render it so fashion
simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop and to have her snuff box filled and and by saying aloud to the young girl who had back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
you are now in the only country in the world where it can make a fortune by selling by the genuine and or a false article and in the first case it receives the welcome of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to rewarded for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and and our ever wonderful it may appear and silliness is the daughter of wit
let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad and but to prove it and indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who had from their birth and are still considered why
it seems to me i replied and that such approval and such ratification of the opinion expressed by the kings princes of the blood et cetera and is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation and for the french carrie that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
when the king comes to paris everybody calls out of lord
she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respective everyone of
what sir i said to him and my fortunate enough to see you
he himself beside the same passage in french and and politely point out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original

i believe it sir and that is what i fear and therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language

he has no traditions to bind him ride him and and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself
a modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthily it might be for a book or for the skilful management of some great newspaper and or for some daring expedition like that of lieutenant trade or doctor kane
he was unable to decide exactly what it
sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a spacious pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance and and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted reached where the date palm groves and then the nightingale voice isn't and the blessings on that night
all seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with a clerk in the ante room the tall office where he was riding and philip invariably advised to settle and no matter how but settled and greatly to the disgust of loiterers who knew that just in man and man could only be attained by the recognised process the attendant if
it is such a noble ambition and that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation
i've been ready to go anywhere for six months
the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure and went down to the wall street office of henry's uncle had had a talk with that wily operator
the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for philip would not take such an important step without of his friends
why it's in missouri somewhere in the front rank will get a map
i was afraid it was near home
he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to practical matters
he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever
she was tired of other things
the study medicine

and besides i suppose he does learn medicine

ruth sat quite still for a time with face intended flushed and it was out now
the sight sir returned in high spirits from the city
ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding moslem and with its great halls and echoing rooms and had no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
and then there was a broad street
there certainly was no end to it and and eve and ruth was philadelphia enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end and more architectural point upon which the weary i could rest
but neither saint jordan nor broad street and neither wonders of the men and nor the glories of the hall and the ghosts of are first always signing the declaration and impress the visitors so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargain on faith street
is he going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
philip therefore red diligently the astor library and plan literary work that should compel attention and nurse his genius
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the drink now and then in session and make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grapevine and see what he could get a line for it
oh very well said griggs turning away with a shade of kept you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford to accost like that
but philip did afford it and he wrote and thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail
and went back to his books and to his waiting for opening large enough for his dignified entrance to the literary world it
well i'm going as an engineer and you could go as one
you can begin by caring rod and putting down the figures in
no it's too soon
he wanted to begin at the top of the latter
she tried this morning nor to upon the piano and sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and and then seating herself by the open window and read philip set in
well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
i hope they told the elders that father and i responsible for a piano and hand that much as he loves music he is never in the room when it is played
i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy and that he was determined to have what compensation he could get down
i was greatly try me ruined and all thy elation
is thy father willingly should go away to a school of the world's people in
i have not asked him truth replied with a look that might implied and that she was one of those determined little bodies and who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up there and in accordance with her son
mother i am going to study medicine
margaret bolt and almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity
i have nothing to wear replied that demure person
it has occupied mother a long time to find the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet
and he won't go and why should i die
if i go to meeting at all and i like best to sit in the quiet old house in german down down where the windows are all open and i can see the tree and here the stir of leaves
such a crushed the yearly meeting had retreated and then there's the road of sleek looking young men who live in the curbstone and stare at us as we come out
he answered but it's on the frontier and hand on the map and everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and and looks as desolate as when day meeting a month and it was time for him to do something
is he going to start a daily newspaper among the cups
father these unjust philip he's going into business
he doesn't say exactly what it is and said ruth a little dubiously and but something about land and railroads and she knows father and that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
but philip is honest and has talent enough and if he will stop scribbling in to make his way in
what a box women are put into and measured for it and put in young and if we go anywhere it's in a box of mail and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
why should i rest and be stupid and and sit in inaction because i am a girl
and if i had a fortune and would be want me to leave a useless life
he consulted thy mother about a cord and i suppose it is a creamy white
but that wise and placid woman understood this we tremble a great deal better than ruth understood herself
ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and and she was sure that his talent and courage would make way for him
eleven o'clock at and it was a fine clear night and they were the only persons on the road and had they sauntered leisurely along and to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation and provide for the two ladies in the valley and or on the banks of the river
secure as he thought and in the careful administration of justice in that city and done the character of its well disposed inhabitants and the good hidalgo was far from thinking that any disaster would befall his family
and rode off and his companions and with their faces muffled in their cloaks and stared rudely and insolently at the mother and the daughter and the servants
in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companion and and in the next moment and there is all to turn back and carried off to please rude and for the rich and harp and had always find parricides ready to encourage their bad propensity and and thus to conceive this wicked design and to communicate it and approve it is all on ravishing mollycoddle and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moan
they drew their swords hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks and turned back and soon came in front of the little party and had not yet done giving thanks to god for their escape and from those audacious men
finally the one party went off exalting and and the other was left in desolation
road also a ride at his own house without any impediment leucadians parents reached their heartbroken despairing
meanwhile rudolf had located the safe in his accustomed and in his own apartment
choking with emotion lady and made a sign to her parents and that she wished to be alone with
that would be very well my child replied her father and if your plans were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning nun but no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he will have set down for certain and that it is taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
what you had best do my child is to keep it and and pray to it and that since it was a witness unto your undoing and it will deign to vindicate your calls and by its righteous judge
thus did the humane and right mind father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again and did all she could do to soothe the feelings
she meanwhile passed her life with her parents and in the strictest retirement and never let herself be seen and buttoning harry lest it should reader misfortune in her face
time rolled on and the hour of her delivery tried it took place in the utmost secrecy and her mother taking upon her the office of midwife and she gave birth to a son and one of the most beautiful ever seen
when the boy walked through the streets and blessings were showered upon him and by all who saw him and blessings upon his beauty and upon the mother that bore him and upon the father that big hill and upon those who brought him up so well
one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to relate and he passed along the street and in which there was a great concourse of horsemen
the bed she too well remembered was there and and above all the cabinet and on which had stood the image she had taken away and was still on the same spot
louis was out of danger in a fortnight and in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time and he was visiting daily by his mother and grandmother and and treated by the master and mistress of the house and as if he was their own child
mother and dear father and do you hear me in
it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me
she found the door but it was locked outside
she succeeded in opening the window and in the moonlight shone so brightly and that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room
she saw that the bed was gilded and and so rich that it seems that of a prince or that of a private gentleman
among other things on and which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver and standing on a cabinet near the window
this person was rudolph who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect and did not think it advisable to acquaint them and with what had passed between him and the girl
on the contrary here is all to tell them that repenting of his violent and unmoved by her tears had only carried her half way towards his house and and then let her go
thus saying and addressing the crucifix to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of donald stuff on and has a gentlewoman and to sex pity is the natural has cruelty to man and instantly pressed her lips to those of the faint england shedding over so many years and that there need no other sprinkling of water to recover the cradle from her swoon
i have great things to tell you senor said nest upon a to her husband the cream and substance and of which is this and the fainting girl before you and is your daughter and the boy is your grandson
this truth and which i have learnt from her lips and is confirmed by his face and in which we have both been held that of oxen
just then loki came to herself and and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of trees and and a gentleman and remaining in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him and from beginning to end and less wholesome and believed in through the blessed sensation of heaven which had confirmed it and by so many convincing testimony
so persuasive were her entreaties and and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them and from the information she sought and they were induced to confess and that one summer night of the same she had mentioned and themselves and another friend being out on the trail with rodolph and they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl and whom rudolph carried off and whilst the rest of them detained her family and who made a great outcry and and would have defended her if they could
for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife or would be agreeable companion and not one and who will disgust me so that we may both berry evenly and with mutual good will the yoke imposed on us by heaven and instead of pulling this way and that way and and fretting each other to death
her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids and with wax lights and silver candles
all rose too and do her reverence and as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them and but gazing on her and entranced with admiration and not one of them was able to oppress a single word to
she reflected how near she stood to the crisis and which was to determined whether she was to be blest or unhappy for ever and and rocked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed color and her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed stiffness
his mother had left her to him as being and her guest and protector but when she saw that he too was insensibly was near making a third would have done so and had not come to himself
oh then and some of my heart and that this fainting lady is your real bride and i say real and because she is the one and whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait a pretense
just at the moment and when the trees of the pitying beholders flowed fasts and and their ejaculations were most expressive of despair and lady gave signs of discovery and and brought back gladness to the hearts of all
when she came to her senses and and blushing to find herself in rodolph foes arms and would have disengage hearse and no son your and that must not be and try not to withdraw from the arms and of him who holds in his soul
this was done for the event took place at a time and when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of marriage and without any of the preliminary formality and which are now so properly required
nor was rudolph less surprised than they and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact and he begged lucrezia to give him some token and which should make perfectly clear to him and that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parent
who touches me and my in bed in
out in the woods stood a nice little
the place he had was a very good one and the sun shone on him and has to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades and pines as well as fur
he did not think of the warm sun and fresh air and he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and rattled when they were in the wood looking for wild strawberries and
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground and a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
oh that made him so angry in
to grow and and groaned and to get older and and beat all thought the tree and that and after all is the most delighting in the world
in autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
something better something still grander must follow and but one
rejoice in our presence said the bear and the sunlight
rejoice in thy own fresh youth
but the tree and did not rejoice at all and he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh and he felt a pang it was like a swoon and he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowfully is separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades and the little bushes and flowers round him any more and perhaps not even the birds and
the departure was not at all agreeable
a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
but i shall tell only once
humpy dumpy fell downstairs and and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fir tree and believed it all and because the man who told the story was so good looking well well done
i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
and a whole night the tree stood still in deep thought
in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in
i am by no means old said the fir tree
there's many a one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely son
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youth and little mice had never heard the like before and and they listened and said
said the fir tree and thinking over what he had himself related
yes in reality and those were happy times
who had his humpy dumpy and passed the mice
only that one answered the tree
this happened every year and and the fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with a noise and cracking in the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were laden carts and the horse is dragged them out of
the tree only came to himself and he was and glowed in the courtyard the other trees and a man said and that one is splendid we don't want the other and
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs and into the loft and here and in a dark corner and when daylight could enter they left him
have you not met them anywhere
rejoice in thy growth and said the sunbeams in
and then what happens then
i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a corner cried the tree rejoicing in
i am now tall and and my ranch is spread like the others that were carried off last year and odin
were i but already on the cotton
were i in the room with all its splendor and magnificence
yes and and something better and something and still grander will surely follow and or wherefore should they thus ornament me
and there were large easy chairs and silken sofas and large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowds and at least and the children said so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look it
blazed up famously and help and help us
cried the young ladies and and they quickly put out the fire
a story in
what's the meaning of this country
and leaned against the wall lost for ever
time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunk in a corner out of the way
in our winter out of doors in the tree
how kind a man is after all
it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
squeak and squeaking
they snuffed about the fir tree and rustle among the branches and
it is a very stupid story
don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles and can't you tell any larder stories
no said the tree
then a good idea said the rats and then
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all and it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and and listened to what i told them
now that too was over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
the trunks were moved and the tree was pulled out and thrown and rather hard it is true and down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the fir tree that they meant and in
it was in a corner that he lay and among weeds and nettles and
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and under so glad at the sight of him in
and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces and there is a whole heap lying in
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and undecided
however and that was over now the tree gone the story and at an end
the three modes of management
to suppose that the objects of this work and his two aged in affecting such a substitution as that and his entirely to mistake his nature and design
by reason and and affection
as the chase drives away and mary stands bewildered perplexed and on the doorstep and her mind and in a tumult and of excitement and in which hatred of the doctor and distrust and and suspicion of her mother and disappointment and vexation and and ill humor and sir and swelled and among those delicate organizations and on which the structure and and development of the soul and so closely depend undoing perhaps had irreparable injury
the mother and as soon as the chase is so far turned and that marry can no longer watch the expression of countenance and goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success and of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl and i know and and not make any trouble and but will stay at home contentedly won't you in
the mother and in managing the case in this way and relies partly upon convincing the reason of the child and and partly and on appeal to her affection
if you should not be a good girl and but should show signs of making us any trouble and i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house and until we are gone
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone and had she been a good girl jane
for instance one day and the children had been playing upon the piazzas with blocks and other playthings and and finally had gone into the house and leaving all the things on the floor of the peace and instead of pushing them away in their places and as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
ella came to the parlour and and with an air of great mystery and beckoned the children aside and said to them and in a whisper leander ellen and rosalie here and don't say a word to them
so saying and she led the way on tiptoe and followed by the children out of the room and and ran down by a circuitous route to the peace and therein
said she and pointing to the playthings unseen
put these playthings hallway quickened and carefully and and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out
and this method of treating the case and was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time and than any direct rebuked sore expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and had the handle was a little crack and and had a new and that one is almost a man and as soon as one has a jack knife
yes why not thought had been
seeing that i am so fine and i may as well go and visit the king in
i am going to the court bald and answered aladdin
and she took his hand and and walk with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and hand through the magnificent halls and their courtiers in silk and velvet and stood burning wherever he went
for and like as not and they must have thought him a prince and when they saw his fine cap
at the farther end of the largest halls and a table was set and with golden cups and and golden plates in long rows
on huge silver platter and were pyramids of tarts and cakes and and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
the prince sat down under the blue canopy and with bouquets of roses and and she let had stood in a golden chair by her side
but you must not meet with your cap on her head she said and and was going to take it off
it is indeed true and that the importance of tact and skill and in the training of the young and hand of cultivating their reason and and securing their affection cannot be overrated in
to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will and or rather of yielding to their influence and are specially useful
well and had a young sister name eolid and a cousin whose name was jane
cordelia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendancy and over the minds of the children and by means of these dolls
to an ideal of these conversations and i will reports one of them in full in
you have come and handled and there was the name of jane's didn't make rosalie of it
i am very glad
i expected you have been a very good girl handle and since you were here last
but this last supposition is almost always necessary for him mary and has been habitually managed and on this principle and she will not make any trouble in
nature of the effect produced by her early impression
that is comparatively nothing
and they are chiefly formed and from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
vast importance and influence and of this mental furnishing
without going to any such extreme as this and we can easily see on reflection harassed and influence on the ideas and conception and as well as on the principles of action in mature years and must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
the pain produced by an act of hasty and an angry violence and to which a father subject his son and may soon pass away and but the memory of it and does not pass away with pain
but had cared nothing about that
he made a bow so deep and that his back and came near breaking and he was dumbfounded and i can tell you and when he saw it was nobody but had been
he was such a big boy and that he wore a high boots and and carried a jack knife
the princess and certainly was beautiful and and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her and but the captain which his mother had made he would not give up upon any condition
he only shook his head
well done and but now said the princess and hand she filled his pockets with cakes and and put her own heavy gold chain round his neck and bent down and and kissed him
that is a very fine cap you have he said
so it is said anne in
and it is made of mothers best yard and had seen it it herself and hand everybody wants to get away from me
with one jump and had got out of his chair
he darted like an arrow through all the halls and down the stairs and hand across the yard
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottages
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother heard that had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said and that hands was a stupid
and his face grew red
but his mother hugged him close
no my little son she said
if you rest in silk and gold from top to toe and you could not look any nicer and than your little red cap
though thrown into prison for this enterprise had detained some time and he was not discouraged and but still continued by his countenance and protection and to infuse spirit and into the distressed royalists
among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord apes of merchants and some of the famous inventor of the log ribbons and the person to whom the title of a great man and is more justly due and than to any other whom his country ever produced
while the former foretold that the scottish covenanters and were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and indicate the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking in the latter still insisted and that harry such attempts would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
the king's ears were now open to montrose counsel and who proposed none but the oldest and most daring and agreeably to the desperate state of the royal called in scotland
five hundred men more and who had been levied by the covenant and were persuaded to embrace the oil corn and with this combined for or he hastened to attack and lord echoed and who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men and assembled upon the first news of the irish innovation
reading the superior power of argyle and who having joined his vassals to aforesaid by the public and was approaching with a considerable army and montrose hastened northward in order to rise again the marquis of country and the gordons and who having before hastily taken arms and had been instantly suppressed by the covenant
this nobleman's character the celebrated for political courage and conduct and was very low for military prowess and and after some skirmishes and in which he was worsted and he he allowed montrose to escape him
by quick marches through these inaccessible mountain and that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenant
with these and some reinforcements of the hath all men and macdonald whom he had recalled and montrose fell suddenly upon argyle country and and let loose upon it all the rage of war or and carrying off the cattle burning the houses and and putting the inhabitants to the sword
this severity by which montrose sullied his victories and was the result of private animosity against the chieftain and as much as of zeal for the public claws and argyle collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy and who had retired with their blood and and he lay at in turkey and supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
by a quick and unexpected march and montrose hastened to intellect and and presented himself in order of battle and before the surprised but not a frightened covenant
his conduct and presence of mind and in this emergency appeared conspicuous
montrose weak in cavalry and he led his troops of horse with infantry and and to put in the enemy's horse to rout and fell with united force upon their foot and who were entirely cut in pieces and though with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalist
from the same men knew regiments and new companies were formed and different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands and as the independents could rely on
besides and members of parliament who were excluded and many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and and and wearily and facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible and more exact plan was introduced and and rigorously executed and by these new commander in
as indeed was very generally diffused over the party as well as the other and during this period undisciplined also was attained by the forces of the parliament and but the perfection of the military art and in concerting the general plan of action and and the operations of the field and seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
historians at least and perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience and have not remarked anything but headlong impetuous conduct and each party hurrying to a battle and ever and fortune chiefly determined the success
he passed through helene's talons and and came so near to london as he rode on the hill
the scottish generals and commissioners unaffected great surprise on the appearance of the king and and though they paid him all the extra respect due to his dignity and they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and and made him in reality a prisoner
they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
or had he given us any gift
and the men of his rail on said the men of judah land said and we have ten parts in the king and and we have also more right in david than ye and why then did ye despise us and that our advice should not be first had and in bringing back our kitchen
another preacher not reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment and roared this seems to be sung
the king stood up and called for that solomon which begins with these words
have mercy lord on me i prayed and four men would be devoured
the good natured and in pity to fall and majesty and showed for once greater deference to the king and that the minister and sung the psalm which the former had called for
the parliament and the scots laid their proposals before the king
if for the settlement of terms and the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and and her incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king and is easily imagined
the english and it is evident and had they not been previously assured of receiving the king and would never have parted with so considerable summoned and while they weakened themselves and by the same measure and have strengthened the people with whom they must afterwards and have so material and interest to discuss it
if any still retained rancor against him and his present condition and they passed in silence and while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with ears and with acclamations and and with prayers for his safety
his death and in this conjunction and was a public misfortune
on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of latter day saint and was formerly organized and thus took in legal existence
its origin was small and a german done insignificant seed and hardly to be thought of as likely to browse opposition
and instead of but six regularly officiated members and and at most two score of adherents the organization numbers to day many hundred thousand souls
in place of a single hamlet and in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated and then our are about seventy stakes of viands and about seven hundred organized wards and each warden steak with its full complement of officers and priesthood organizations
the practice of gathering its proselytes into one place and prevent the building up and strengthening of four branches and and in as much as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with a broad and very erroneous ideas existed concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless the mustard seed and among the smallest of all season and has attained the proportions of a tree and and the birds of their resting in its branches the cord is now no conferring protection and the sweets of satisfaction to harry ernest pilgrim journeying sway for truth
and their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun and not merely that the work of raw saluting should be carried on in the west and but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
the book of men had taught the people the true origin and destiny and of the american indians abundant war this dark skinned remnant of a once mighty peopled and the missionaries of mormonism and he turned their eyes and and with their eyes in their hearts and their hopes
oh what a record tredah and what a picture to gaze upon her all the fact
american schoolboys reed with emotions of horror and of the cabbages and driven beaten and killed and the apple gained erecting a butchery and and of the old world and hunted and howard like beasts and has the effect of a royal decreed and and they yet tarried in the history of their own country and of scenes as terrible as these and the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hated
who began the quarrel was it the mormons in
as a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the missouri uns i quote a paragraph and from the quincy argus and march sixteenth eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that an organized mob and made by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor bogs at their head and have been the prominent actors in this business and incited to it appears against the mormons by political hatred and and by the additional motive of plunder and revenge
the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative well
but a word further concerning the expedition in general
it is through lloyd's advice that you can order the military expedition two tall and ostensibly and to install certain federal officials and to repress and alleged in fine style rebellion and which in fact had never come into existence and but in reality to further the interests of the session system
the first well established seat of the church and was in the pretty little town of curl and ohio and almost within sight of lake erie and and he soon rose the first temples of modern times
to the fervent latter day saint a temple is not simply h building and house for religious assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes in missouri and independence jackson county being their centre and but from the first they were and popular among the missouri and
the lieutenant governor a little bird a bog and afterward governor and was pronounced mormon hayter and and throughout the period of the troubles and he manifested his sympathy with the persecutors
their sufferings and have never yet been fitly chronicle by human scribe
making their way across the river and most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and and afterwards established themselves in called well county and there in founding the city of far weston
a small settlement had been found by mormon families on show creek and and here on the thirteenth of october eighteen thirty eight and a company of two hundred and forty and fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered score
be it said to the honor of some of the officers intrusted with the terrible commission and that whether it's true significance and they resigned their authority and rather than have anything to do with what they designated cold blooded butchery
already the north and south were talked of why not set up also weston
they knew no north and south nor east nor west and they stood positively by the constitution and none would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers and unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which and they had already once loyal responded and to furnish met in arms for their country's need
what the latter day saint call celestial marriage and is characteristic of the church and and is in very general practice and but of celestial marriage a plurality of wives was an incident and never an essential
we believe in a literal resurrection and natural hereafter and in which future state shall be recognized harry sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth and a parent and child and brother and sister and husband and wife
and it has been my privilege and to tread the soil of many lands and to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place and me the people and where and with whom the purity of man and woman and is held more precious than among the maligned mormons in the mountains valleys of the west
at the inception of plural marriage among the latter day saint and there was no law national or state against its practice and
in eighteen sixty two and a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage and hands had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage and it lay for many years a dead letter
federal judges and united states attorneys in you tall and who were not mormons nor lovers of mormonism and refused to entertain complaints and or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and in adequacy
this meant and that for a ledge misdemeanor and rich congress prescribe a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and dandified of three hundred dollars and a man might be imprisoned for life and i form any terms of a man's natural life and the courts power to enforce its sentences extend so far and and and might be find millions of dollars and
for this trusty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and and there met with the reversal and rebuked deserved and men were imprisoned under sentence of many years duration
the people contested these measures one by one the courts and presenting in case after case and the different phase of the subject and and urging the constitution of the measure in
then the church was incorporated and and its property both real and personally and confiscated uninitiated to the government of the united states and and although the person of property was soon restored and real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the course receiver and and the more manner had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story of mormonism runs on and its finale has not yet been written the current represent continuously and new stages of its progress and new developments of its plan
it is notable that the indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the latter day saint with favor and seeing in the book of men and striking agreement with their own traditions

what she wanted from us was neither flowers nor ranks but just youth
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money and god give you a happy lover
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply and had frightened them both
barley stood when hill rang the little bell beside her and dear me why did you do that
it was very jolly he murmured lazy as mary came in to take away the coffin

when she finished and alexander shook himself out of a reverie
nonsense of course i can't really sink and except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
it's really too warm in this room to sink and don't you feel it in
alexander went over and opened the window for her in

he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said and it softened misty and see how white the stars are
for a long time neither hill or barley spoke
he felt a tremour ran through the slender yellow figure in front of him

alexander paced up and down the hallway and buttoning and and buttoning his overcoat and until she returned and took him up to hills living room
the room was empty when he entered in
alexander did not sit down
i felt in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
i understand barley and i was wrong in
i thought it might be straight or cousin my could be happening along in
she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth and her knees drawn up to her chin and laughing like a happy little girl
when did you come barley and how did it happen and you haven't spoken a word in
i got in about ten minutes agone
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blazing

she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head and thrust forward like a catapult in leaned
i'll do anything you wish me to barley she said tremulously
i can't stand seeing you miserable
he pulled up a window as if there were heavy in
hill watched him from the corner and trembling and scarcely breathing and dark shadows growing about her eyes and in

alexander groaned i meant to and but somehow i couldn't
she pressed his hand gently in gratitude in

she closed her eyes and took a deep breath and as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days and
he moved uneasily and his chair creaked and
yes yes she hurried and pulling her hand gently away from him in
please tell me one thing barley and at least and tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy

it is one of the masterly and charming stories of dismal
in five minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company
the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to regions of reality
ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room
he signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father
the door opened again while i was still studying the two brothers and without i honestly confess being very favorably impressed by either of them
a new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention and entered the room
for once in a way i proved a true prophet
the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between him and me
he looked up at naomi doubtingly from his plated and looked down again slowly with a frown
when i addressed him he answered constraint
a more and more this united family party i never sat at the table with
envy hatred malice and uncharitable us are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by the sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in naomi and my other interest in the little love looks which i now and then surprised passing between her and ambrose and i should never have sat through that supper

my men laughed and yes a stingy hostess
he acts as though he had not expected us
on a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together
ring in the table we are hungry
the rolls were ringing in a great pot of meat
they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched boil while we joked and at last the supper began
the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw a spitting pot full of his good beef and bass six loaves of bread into rig mouths

he seemed more to please without being conscious of the power he possessed
it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself and that his literary attainments were by no means of high order
we don't spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers and indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning thompson
once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through and intrenchment
sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would in joy ride along the summit of the cliff and altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end
no cathedral not even burgo itself and could vie with chat martin
ben zoof most ambitious desire and was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and and so incessantly were servadac ears besieged with descriptions and of the unparalleled beauties and and advantages of this eighteenth and darned small of paris and that he could scarcely hear the name of martin without conscious thrill of aversion
the wind being adverse and the dobryna did not make very rapid progress and but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
servadac took it for granted that the breed was endeavoring to ten
a narrow channel for a passage through the ridge of rocks and that protect it from the open sea and and which and even in the roughest whether would insure the calmness of its waters
slightly changing her course she first struck her mainsail and and in order to facilitate the movements of her helm none soon cared nothing but her to top sails and brigantine and been
captain servadac hastened toward him
i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
never mind now interpose the captain and we will talk of that by and by
nothing more than you know your self
a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent changes in the general order of the day but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit and was a question which would still require several days to decide
down the road and some discussion followed and whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master
her sea going qualities were excellent and and would have amply sufficed for us come navigation of the globe
and after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time and throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean and whilst in the summer he visited more northern
the late astounding events however had rendered pro cope manifestly uneasy and and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
steam up and canvas spread the schooner starting eastward
and although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough and a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant and that by the mere fact of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
the bond of union thus effect in every severed and and although ben zoof achievements had fairly heard him the right of retirement firmly declined all honor or any pension that my part him from his superior officer
and like his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power and but his inexhaustible memory and made him a living encyclopaedia london for his stock of anecdotes and troopers tales he was matchless
fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
it was quite true that the vessel was in sight and hardly more than six miles from the shore and but owing to the increase in the earth's convex city and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the top masts alone was visible above the water
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye and moved at his telescope
she is under sail but she is count timascheff yacht was right
and if the count on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival in
he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe and but upon learning it's called
when a private in the eighth cavalry and he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age and but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
are you certain that this is the mediterranean
the log and a compass therefore and were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about and a convulsion of the elements
you will take me on board count will you not
my yacht is at your service sir and even should you requite make a tour round the world
the count shook his head in
before starting it was indispensable that the end of the dobryna should be repaired and to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seasoned be both tedious and difficult
and it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were complete in
there's no fear of that certain
the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but and she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated on to the sun
and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly and that will not happen
notion reigned supreme
and all the images of his past life floated upon his memory and his thoughts sped away to his native france and only two returned again to wonder whether the depths of ocean and would reveal any traces of the algeria metropolis
is it not impossible he murmured a loud and that any city should disappear so completely
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible and
another circumstance was most remarkable
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at nearly uniform death and of from four to five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours and over a considerable aerial the differences of level were insignificant and not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terraced and like the seats of an amphitheater
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagine it
and after pondering a while he said and if we were farther away and i should expect to find a depth and of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
its depth remained invariable and still for or at most five fathoms and and although its bottom was assiduously regiment was only to prove it baron of reproduction of any type
nothing was to be done but put about and and return in disappointment or the north
you know captain lake in
said lord chelford addressing me
he had his hand upon lake shoulder
they are cousins you know and we are all cousin
whatever lord chelford said and miss brandon received it very graciously and and even with a momentary smile
but her greeting to captain lake and was more than usually haughty and frozen under her features i fancied and particularly proud and pain
at dinner lake was easy and music
and i'm glad you like it says wider and chuckling indignantly on it over his shoulder in
all the time he was talking to me and angry little eyes were following me in it
miss lake declined the carriage to night
and had something still less complementary
but these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly in
in the meantime had formed a new idea of her
by this time lord chelford edward returned and disgusting rather with myself and my ruminated on my want of generalship
and made a little trip of his cane tow'rds brandon hall and over his shoulder
yes so they said and but that would i think i have been worse
mark my words and you'll find him too strong for you and i and two deep
i am very uneasy about whatever it is and i can help it
to my mind there have always been something inexpressibly often family feud in
the mystery of their origin and their capacity for revolving latent faculties of crime and and a steady vitality with which they serve the hearse and and seek their deep mouths malignity ease in ev'ry newborn generation and have a sated them somehow in my mind with the spell of life succeeding and distinct human and a special satanic action
for more than anything else showed the great age of the room in
my bed was an exceptionally comfortable and buttoned in my then mood and i could have wished it a great deal more modern
dis curtains were of thick and faded tapestry in
all the furniture belonged at other times
so there came a step and had a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome in
women can hide their pain better than we men and and bear it better to and except when shame grapes fire into the dreadful chalice
but poor rachel lake and had more than that stoical hypocrisy and which enables the tortured spirit of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smiling
this granite spring and lighting up you and a glamor beguiling their senses
there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner and which was new to rachel and and comfort and and she returned the greeting has kindly and and felt more like her former self
rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilate died and struck her with a painful surprise in
you've been so ill my poor rachel
and trouble dear and troubled in mind and miserable nervous
poor rachel her nature recoiled from defeated and she told at all events and as much of the truth as she dared
and i believe i have a little taste that way and those are all real you know and those jewels
or fellows in a little bit wide and easy as a bob at once
i sha'n't trouble you about my train of thought or fancies and but i began to feel very like a gentleman in the ghost story and watching experimentally in the haunted chamber
and placed it in that gentleman's fingers and who now took his turn at the lamp and and contemplated the little peril epigram with a gleam of sly amusement
i was thinking it's very like the face of heart and answered the captain softly smiling on it
whereupon lake laughed quietly and still looking on the face of hearts with his slides in
and wild laughed and more suddenly and noisily and than the humor of the joke seemed quite call for and and glanced grim look from the corners of his eyes on me but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and and after a few seconds more he had it very innocently and back to missus darcy and only remarking in
do you know a lake and ho i really can't tell and but he soon tire of country life
he's not a man for country quarters in
i had a hard dream about him last night then
oh i know that your brandon
rakitin is a very good fellow i can assure you
i don't know and can't say how you find gentlemen defined wickedness and only as an obscure female and i speak according to my lightened and he is generally thought and the wickedest man in this county
well you know radie and women like wicked fellows and it is contrast i suppose but they do and and i'm sure from what bracton has said to me and i know him intimately and that dorcas likes him and and i can't conceive why they are not married
their walk continued silent for the greater part and neither was quite satisfied with the other and but rachel at last said one
now that's impossible lady and for i really don't think i once thought of him all this evening and except just while we were talking
there is a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and and a model lights and shadows and glided hardly across his pale features
don't insult me stanley by talking again as you did this morning
what i say is altogether on your own account
i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
i boldly blighted my route
a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows in
a somber old trees and like gigantic hearse plumes and black and often
somehow i had grown nervous
a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and and startled me confoundedly in
it was not very much past eleven that morning the pony carriage from brandon and grew up before the little garden wicket of redman's farm
well she was better though she had had a bad night
she spoke with sudden energy and which partook of fear and passion and and flushed his cheek and and made her languid eyes flashed
thank you rachel and my cousin rachel and my only friend
telford had a note from mister wilder this morning and another noted his coming delayed and and something of his having to see some person who was abroad continued dorcas after a little pause
yes something everything said rachael and hurriedly looking frowningly at a flour which he was twirling in her fingers
yes said rachel in
and the wand oracle and having spoken and she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and and she looked full in his eyes
of mark wylder i say this and his name has been for years hateful to me and and recently it has become frightful and and you will promise me simply this you will never ask me to speak again about him
it is an antipathy and and antipathies i cannot get over dear dark and you may think it a madness and but don't blame me in
i have very few to love me now and and i thought you might love me and as i have begun to love you
and she threw her arms round his neck and and brave rachel at last burst into tin
dorcas and in her strange way and was moved
i like you still rachel and i'm sure i always like you
you resemble me rachel and you are fearless and inflexible and generous
yes rachel i do love you in
thank you doctrine
he began a confused complaint against the wizard and had vanished behind the curtain on the left
is not so ernest a mind to these memories child
and a golden fortune and a happy life
he was like unto my father in awakened and yet was not my father
also there was a stripling page and he turned into a maiden
this was so sweet a lady sir and and in some manner i do think she died
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came
sister well do you hear these marvelous
take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you
like as not young master and though i am an old man
for with all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss and but master will who peeped out first and did no more than one glance
he gave way to the others very readily and mistreated unperceived by the squire and mistress fitzooth to the rear of the tent
cries of nottingham and nottingham
before them fled the troll and his three sons and cap and terrified
what is the tumult and writing cried out the squire authoritatively and blue twice on the silver whistle which hung at his belt
and we refuse their request most politely most noble said the little australian
and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us
i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of cumberland son
so i did push this fellow
it is enough said george gamewell sharply and as he turned upon the crowd in
shame on eustaces cried he and i blush for my fellows of nottingham
surely we can submit with good grace and
it is fine for you to talk old man answered the lean sun apprentice in
but he wrestled with this fellow and and do you know that he played and fairly in the second out
spoke the choir losing all patience and and it was to you that i gave another person consolation
come to me men and here here and he raised his voice still louder one
the strollers took their part in it with hearts now that they had some chance of being off their foes
robin and a little tumbler between them tried to force the choir to stand back and very gallantly did these to support themselves in
ahead in chief of the riot the nottingham apprenticed and with clenched fists threat not fashion
the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
now be silent on your eyes he began but the captured apprentice set up an instant shouted
silence you knave cried dot fishin
he felt for and found the wizards black cloth and the sky was quite out of breath in
thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent and robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout and
dmitri made a mighty shade and gamewell to the rescue
taking advantage of the squire's few men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robin's and a little strollers cries and fought their way to him
george monte she will never forget this done
what is your name lording asked the little strolls presently
robin fitzooth
and my is will stuteley and shall we be comrades
right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin
i like you will and your the second will that i have met and liked within two days and is there a sign that
montalais called out for robin to give him an arm
friends said monte shape faintly to the wrestlers and bear us escort so far as the sheriff's house and
it will not be safe for you to stay here now in
pray follow us with mine my lord sheriff's men
nottingham castle was reached and admittance was demanding
master on so the sheriff of nottingham was mightily put about when told of the rioting in
and henry might return to england at any moment
have your will child if the boy also will it not be made answer feeling too ill to suppose anything very strongly just then
he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tightened upon his arm
make me a room with the air of a child quickly in
but who is this fellow plucking tossed even
he is my squier excellence returned robin with dignity in
mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriff's daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of monte shade
and robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices in
the wind certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks
these escapades are not for old gamewell lad and his day has come to twilight in
will you forgive me now done
it will be no disappointment to me in
no thanks and i am glad to give you such easy happiness in
your worth he will presently whispered robin and the wind has worked marvel
die and show you some pretty tricks
young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire
there befell an anxious interview and mistress fitzooth arguing for and against the squires project in a breath
most of all robin thought of his father and what would he counsel in
dear will you beg your self i cannot stay you in
but take it whilst i listened and where motley chaise shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight and for you will never disgrace are dutchman i warrant me
save me masters but you startled me rarely
the lad had checked him then
and never that sir he had said and
he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm in
now to bed doin
tis late and and i go myself within a short space
dismiss your squire robin and bid me good in
has any in england i would say said gamewell proudly and that in his done
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come in
there is no chance to alter his sleeping room to one near to gamewell chamber
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided stepped in
will cried he softly and and stuteley had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber and sprang up at once in answer in
we will go out together to the bower and there is a way down to the court from my window
dressed and be still until i warn you
the hours passed wearily bind and movement could yet be heard about the hall and
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell
will and whispered robin opening his door as he spoke and are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made safe crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling squire after him
be not so foolish friend said it so crossly in
they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut and groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrant had filled his mission
they were upon the verge of the open trap in a far corner of the hut and and stately had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat south of this pit
it's the hand resting at last upon the top of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descend the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
still was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice and written
cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him in
enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him in
truly such a horse would be worth much in nottingham fair in
nay nay lording and answered wharton with a half laughing
or written spoke thus with significance to so robin that he was not to think jeffreys claims to the state would be passed by in
robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of war and had been fair and and became ashamed of himself for harbouring them
his tones rang pleasantly on wharton's ears and and forth with the good fellowship was heralded between them in
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passage way led from the hut in the pleasantest sherwood and and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter and for in sooth his life in the hollow of hands
they regain their apartment apparel without disturbing the household vein wherein
kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visited but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and and tom gates bade fair to serve a length of time in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act
i can't see it in that light said the old loin
it was a deliberate theft from his employer to protect a girl he loved
but they could not have proven the case against lucy and if she was innocent and and all their threats of resting her were probably a mere bluff
he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and and being in love he did not stop to count the cost
if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check and then the young man would be allowed his freedom in
and the circumstances and i doubt if such an arrangement could be made in
worse tom worse than ever replied the jailer gloomily in
mister grass said kenneth and noticing the boy's face critically and as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
are we haven't any reception room in the jail in
sit down please said katy in a cheerful and pleasant voice and there's a bench herein
a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates and with steady gray eyes and and intelligent forehead and but a sensitive rather weak mouths
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and and interested in it
i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not and i did it and i'm glad i did it
old will is a fine fellow and a poor and helpless missus rogers had her accident
i'm going to see mister martial said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you and thank you sir in
it won't be much but i'm grateful to find a friend
they left him then for the jailer tried to unlock the door and asked them to the office
i've seen lots of that kind in my done
and it ruins man's disposition
he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated in
some girl has been here twice to interview i mentioned and have refused to admit in
i'm not electioneering just now done
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
he might have had that forged check for the face of it and if he'd been sharpen
and to think and we can save all that misery and despair and by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends and mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forms and aggressive campaigns and with an equal aggressive nuts and and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
one of mister hopkins first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen round him and was to make a careful canvas of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and and a couple of hundred notes in one way or the other and secured from a position
the democratic committee and figured out a way to do this
under ordinary conditions and reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee propose to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins
fare you was twelve miles away and but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail
then rogers wouldn't do anything but leader round and weighed upon her and and the place went to rack and ruin
oh well sir what about him in
the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and and this hopkins ranged personally
die attend to the household mending you know and and care for the linen
we ought to have more tenants beth said louise approaching her cousin
don't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maiden
she was very fond of the young ladies and whom she had known when aunt jane was their mistress here and and beth was her especial favorite
the housekeeper led the way and beth followed
for a moment beth stood staring and while the new made regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
she was dressed in a regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst and a plain black gowned and with a white apron and cap
then she gave a little laugh and replied and no miss beth i'm elizabeth parson
but it can't be protested the girl
they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer in
we wish to talk with him and answered kenneth and talk
i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly in
oh that's different observed markham altering his demeanour and
may we see gates at once kenneth in
they followed the jailer and along a succession of passage in
sometimes and i'm that yearning for the smoke i'm nearly crazy and i don't know which is worse die in one way or the other in
he unlocked the door and called and here's visitors tom in
he spoke simply and but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them in
whose name do sighed the check cast kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the check of the concern
it's a stock company and rich
i was bookkeeper and so it is easy to get a blank check and for the signature
as regards and my robbing the company and i say that i saved him a heavy loss and gain
i discovered and put out the fire and that would have destroyed the whole plant and but martial never even thank me
it was better for him to think the girl and feeling than to know the truth
and deserves the term in state's prison
it has cost me twice sixty dollars and annoyance
i'll pay all the cost beside it
your foolish why should you do all this
i have my own reasons mister martin
give me a check for a hundred and fifty and and i turned over to you the forged check and wash further proceeding in
he detested the grasping disposition and that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
beth uneasy at his silence nudged him in
and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political egan was so numerous and diverting and that they were both laughing heartily over the thick and when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice how the occupants of the other evil words
these women were flattered and by the attention of the young lady and and had promised to assist in collecting mister forbes
louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and and wished and the entertainment to be so affective and in winning their good will and that they would work earnestly for the calls in which they were enlisted
a fair view band was engaged to discourse and has much harmony as it could produced and and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guest
tables were spread on the lawn and and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
this was the first occasion and within a generation and when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and and the only one and within the memory of man and where the neighbours and country people had been the invited guests
the attendants was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted and foreseeing great success for their fight

at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock and the king entered his cabinet and where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring and which was the result of so much imagination and and had lost so many efforts of thought to the desires and ornament workers the court

the arrow pierced his heart and and wounded him mortally
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre and but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back and or perhaps of all love is the strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart

in fact and he had just finished and the last of the trout tale had just vanished with a spasm down his strange glutton and when the baffled hook caught sight of him and swooped
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright and motionless as if surprised
like his unfortunate little cousin the tale he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank and deep fringed with weeds and the dreadful eye of the hawk could not discern him
the hawks sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface

the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and and is the most difficult part of the whole enterprise
what is called perception and differ from sensations by the fact that the sensational ingredients become habitual associates and images and expectations of their usual correlated all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether or not this principle is liable to exception and everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth and though the word exactly might seem an over statement and it might seem more correct to say and that ideals approximate represent
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical him possibility in the hypothesis and that the world sprang into being five minutes ago and exactly as it then was and with a population that and remembered the holy and real past
all that i am doing it to its logical to ability and as a help in the analysis of occurs when we remember
the behavior us to attempt to make psychology a record of behavior and has to trust his memory in making the record
a habit and is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behavior must feel confident that there is such a phenomenon has habit and that can only be because he trusts his memory and when it assure him that there have been other time
but i do not think such a difference is warranted
our confidence for lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must and in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot invoke the past bodily and compare it with the present him
we sometimes have image is that are by no means and peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust and for example and under the influence of fatigue and we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly and but horribly distorted
some image is like some sensation feel very familiar and while others feel strange
familiarity is a feeling capable of degree in
and in an image of a well known face for example and some parts may feel more familiar than others and when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than that of the unfamiliar pa
i come now to the other characteristic which memory image is must have and in order to account for knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic and which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
there may be a specific filling a witch and could be called the filling of past and especially where immediate memory is concern
there is of course and a difference between knowing the temporal relations of a remembered event to the present and and knowing the time ordered to remember event
and it would seem that unholy rather recent events can be placed at all accurately and by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present and buttoned it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part and in the process of dating remembered event
if we had retained a subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence and in some way resembling related to and what is remembered
some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must drive it
in this case and has been most others and what may be taken as certain and advanced his rather vague
the first of a vague but did but a little and is that his knowledge of the past
we might provisionally and though perhaps not quite correctly undefined and memory and has that way of knowing about the past which has no man a log in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned and though some expectations may deserves to rank with memory as regards and immediately
this distinction is vital to the understanding of me but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
the gramophone by the help of suitable records and might relate to us the incidents of its past and and people are not so different from gramophone as they liked to believe
and i can set to work now to remember things i never remember before and such as what i had to eat for breakfast and and it can hardly be wholly habit and that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem and does not show that he remembers any previous occasion and on which he has restored it
symonds two books and mentioned in earlier lecture and do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds and but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrence and which is what constitutes a knowledge men
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable and almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known delusion that all that is happening in happened before us
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without definite objects it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate objects which and leads us to the judgment this is familiar
the snow knowledge has to the past and is to be dried from the feeling of familiarity alone
the first stage is recognition
recognition in this sense and does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association with a kind of objects we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat and or with the trim jumping and or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize cat of them
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognise an object that we have seen it before and but this judgment is something over and above recognition and in this first sense and and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition and in this first sense of the word
this knowledge his memory in one sense and though in another it is not
there are however and several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct and to define recognition has and i have seen this been than has and this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficult and broadly speaking is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now done by certain links of which the various forms of memory and are among the most important
the sun if i recognize indication of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of and my experience and by definition and recognition will be one of the marks by which my experiences singled out from the rest of the world
of course and the words and this has existed before and are of very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable and words are framed to express a level of thought and which is by no means primitive and and and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence and has recognition
and this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was

chapter three and has master wishes
three seconds before the rival of jamie robin's letter and i know more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the north west passage
and so i had just returned from a arduous journey and exhausted and bleeding unrest
i want nothing more than to see my country again and my friends and my modest quarters by the botanical garden and my dearly beloved collection
but now nothing could hold me back
caused was my man servant
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in are little universe by the botanical gardens and the boy had come to know a thing or two
classifying was everything to him and so he knew nothing else and well versed in the theory of classification and he was poorly versed in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a balloon whalen
and yet what a fine gallant lad
and not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey in
never did he object to bustling up his suitcase for any country whatever and china or the cargo and no matter how far off it was in
he went he there and everywhere in perfect contentment
please forgive me for this underhand way of admitting that i had turned forty
he was a fanatic on formality none he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it tiresome
there was good reason to stop and think and even for the world's most him motionless man
dante i called a third time unconscious appeared
did master some money he said entering
pack as much into my trunk as you can and my travelling christ's shirts and socks and don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurried
we'll deal with them later and what
anyhow we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
yes we are certainly replied evasively and but after we make a d tour
drought slightly less erect that's all
leaving on the abraham lincoln
you see my friends it's an issue of the monster a notorious darwin
we don't know where it will take it
but we're going just the same
we have a commander whose game for anything
i left instructions for shipping my container of stuffed animals and dried plants paris france
i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the bristle and and ka say at my heels and jumped into a carriage
dragging was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate and i rushed toward it
i asked for commander arrogant
one of the sailors led me to the after deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer and he extended his hand to me
in person well come aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
i was well satisfied with my cab and which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess
will be quite comfortable here i told conniston
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition and whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
the wars of brook londonderry part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers in
departing from five hundred thousand throats and three cheers burst forth in succession
and thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses and hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
i remained there alone for many hours and but i must acknowledge that before i left the chamber i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
have crasweller not been good looking and had jack been still at college and had sir kennington oval remained in england and had mister bennet and the bar keeper not succeed in stopping my carriage on the hill and should i have succeeded in a raging for the final departure of my old friend and
on driving at home at my own president i found that rossland was filled with a brilliant company
has i spoke and i made him gracious bowed and and i think i showed him by my mode of address and that i did not bear any grudge at my individual self
i have come to your shores mister president and with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarters of the world
we have a little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
we are quite satisfied now captain battle axe said my wife
quite satisfied said evil in
the ladies and in compliance with that softness of heart and which is their characteristic and on one side and the men and by whom the world and has to be managed on the other
no doubt and in process of time and the ladies will follow in
their master said missus neverbend in
i did not mean said captain bulk to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
missus neverbend you must indeed be proud of your son
jack had been standing in a far corner of the room talking to me and was now reduced to silence by his praise in
descending tole is a very fine place said my wife
i and my wife and son and the two crasweller and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republican and and endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity and as might be fit the kind but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
my wife and on the spur of the moment manage to give the gentleman of very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality and and i am not sure that i did not agree with her
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives and who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes said jack and i know where
but i mean to have my things before long
of what missus neverbend had gone through a providing birds beasts and fishes and not talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day and no one but myself can have any idea and but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task throw success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
how much of evil of real accomplished and had there not occurred to me during the last few days
what could i do now but just laid myself down and die
and the death of which i dreamt could not alas
when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england and he would return to a small farm and which i possessed at the first sight of the island and there in solution would i end my days
jack would become evils happy husband and would remain a mist and the hurried duties of the eager world
and thinking of all this and i went to see
mister neverbend began the captain and and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as a present and it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality and for which your character in england stands so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so superior to any that i can advance and as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to
and not a doubt and but for force been only doubled horrible road and i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister neverbend and said sir ferdinand brown
i can afford to smiled because i am absolutely powerless before you and but i do not the less feel and that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i did or rather we and have been put down by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
and therefore and i feel myself quite able as president of this republican to receive you with a courtesy due to the service of a friendly line
i can assure you has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
and then said sir ferdinand oh and there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeds anything which i had yet felt
do you hear what sir ferdinand rode round has said replied captain battle axe
but what is the delicate mission in passing
i was to be taken away and carried to england and or elsewhere and or ground upon a voyage it mattered not which
then the republic of britain you'll and was to be declared as non existent on the british flag was to be exalted and british governor installed in the executive chamber in
and you may be quite sure it's there said captain bulk and that i can see you it has two half obliterate or town within two minutes of my return on board
you propose to kidnap me i said
what would become of your gun and were i to kidnap you in
lieutenant crossed reads a very gallant officer
one of us always remains on board while the others on shore
what worldwide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain and for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible and my dislike centered itself on sir ferdinand
you will allow me to suggest said he and that that is a matter of opinion
were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
the letter ran as follows
sir and have it in command to inform your excellency and that you have been appointed governor of the crowd colony and which is called britain you'll
the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellencies knowledge in
but in their selection of a constitution and the return you listened have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence and has sprung their present difficult
it is found on the acknowledge weakness of those who survived that period of life at which men ceased to work
but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
john bright his arm with a weapon of great power and against and which it is impossible that the people of britain you'll should prevail in
you will carry out with you and men of the north northwest birmingham regiment which will probably suffice and for your own secure and has it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn and the people will river easily to their old habits of obedience
when do you intend that the john bright shall start
to die out in
and have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government
i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir fern
they of course it must all be lost
or of the habits of people and it is quite impossible
your power is sufficient i said
if you'll give us your promise to meet captain battle axe here at this time to morrow and we will stretch appointed lay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
and this plan was adopted in order to extract from a promise that i would depart in peace
then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard and shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recapture it
hold him fast my men and and as soon as i had my coffee and oatmeal and i'll take it to the room of the great knife and catch him
i wouldn't mind a cup of coffee myself could have had considerable exercise this morning and and more ready for breakfast
but captain bill made no such attempt and knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the blue gave a yell of disappointment
the room of the great knife was high and began and round it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon
in one place at the head of the room and was a raised platform for the royal family and with elegant thrown chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snub nosed princesses
therefore her majesty paid no attention to any one and and no one paid any attention to her in
rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and and royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing
morning glow people as well as you look
control yourselves my dears replied the blue and the worst punishment i know how to inflict on any one this prisoner is about to suffer and you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters in
suppose it's of brandon
the captain shook his head in
why you sent to fetch the first living creature we met and and that was the signet replied the captain panting hard as he held fast and the goat's horn
the idea of catching cat and built a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it and the more he roared with laughter
they look something like you know suggested that the guards looking from one to the other doubt and had then nearly the same size if you stand alone on his hind legs and they both got the same style of whiskers and had their both of them obstinate and dangerous and so they ought to make a good patch appended
fine and glorious
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away and seemingly of its own accord and and was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the blue room
before he could stop him he baited his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and untroubled in a heap among the benches and where he lay groaning and groaning
the goat warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack
then they sped in great haste for the door and and the goat gave a final but that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangled and whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voice is
i had a notion it was you might have saved me from the knife
and i couldn't shiver much being bound so tight but when i'm loose i mean to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings
come and get the old road he said and going toward the benches
so they were quite willing to obey the order of their girl queen and in a short time the blast of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of symbols told trot and cap'n bill that the blue band had assembled before the palace
then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and hand was advancing steadily toward them
at the head of the pinkies were big sizzle and button bright and who had the parrot on his shoulder and and they were supported by captain coralie and and captain tents and rosalie the witch
when the blueskins skip curses they raised another great shouted for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
since last thursday july and priscilla and have been the lawful to approve of the blue country and but now that you are conquered by queen trot and i suppose i am conquered to and you have no blue at all
when he finished she said cheerfully done
don't worry sizzle dear and it'll all come right pretty soon
now then let's enter the city and enjoy the great feasts being cooked i'm nearly starved myself and for this conquering kingdoms hard work
then she gave rosalie back her magic ring and thanking the kind which for all she had done for them
you are matron replied the sailor
it will be such a satisfaction
the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanting to fight and but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the blue out of the frame he was tied in and and brought both him and the goat before we trotted who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
i will gladly do that promise the two blue and and i feed the honorable go till the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass
excuse me and said trot and neglect to tell you that you're not the boolooroo any more
the former blue groan
i'll not be wicked any more aside the old bundle reform
as a private citizen i shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever and but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them and for there is not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princess is the least little bit
said ghip ghisizzle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evening and trot gave a grand ball in the palace and to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited and
the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
brighter than he does most brilliant dire blow clear bands of color through the sky that's world and and sweep and meat and to break and foam like rainbow veils upon a bubbles dome
guided by you and how we might strolled towards death and our only music one another breath and through garden intimate with hollyhock and where silent poppies bird between the rocks and by pools where birches bent confidant above green water some with lily plants
venice
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold and shields and the glory of the world and reached kings galley who sails offered his hung with tapestry rich and hold
the pity that we must come and go in
while the old gold and the marble stayed or ever gleaming its soft straw blaze and calm in the early evening glow
the pleasant graveyard of my soul with sentimental cypress trees and flowers is filled and that i may stroll in meditation at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and snow clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
over the track lined city street the young men and the grinning men and passed
ho de sales that seem to wander in refilled meadows and say and is the shore where i stand the only field of struggle and dorry hit and battered out thereby waves and win gusts has stepped over a clashing sea of watery echoes
hold dances are simplified of their yearning and bleached by time
he had got into her courtyard
through the black knight trade and he sang to her window bar
that was but rustling of gripping plants in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into her courtyard
to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day and down by the river and a docile and her soft voice is heard and and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew
no life and of this spring
and why fades the lotus of the water
died these children of the prison
l is and like a wat'ry bold and like a parting cloud and like a reflection in a glass and like shadows in the water and like dreams of it and like a smile upon an infant face
like the doves voice and liked transiently and like music in the air a doll
and gentle sleep and the sleep of death and and gently hear the voice of him and that walking in the garden in the hearing
the lily of the valley being in the humble grass and he answered the lovely maiden said and i am a watery weed and i am very small and and loves to dwell in lowly veiled and so weak and the gilded butterfly scarce and perching on my head and yet i am visit from heaven and and he that smiles on all and walks in the valley and and each more over me and spreads his hand and saying and rejoice thou humble grass and thou and newborn lily flower
the cloud then showed and his golden head and his bright former in
and fiercer because i vanish and and me no more
and it is too and tenfold life and to love to peace and and rapture and wholly undone seen descending and white wings upon balmy flower and and court the fair i do not take me to her shining tent and the weeping virgin trembling knees before the risen sun
till we prize linked and in a golden band never part but walk and unite bearing and food to all are tender flower
is not alone and nor of itself or not and i will call and the weaker from its lonely bed and thou shalt hear its voice
come forward and the silent valley and to thy pensive queen
a helpless worm a rose and and sat upon the lily leaf and and a bright cloud sailed on to find his partner in the vale
image of weakness and art thou but a worm and
when called before and i told her hastily i dropped my flower and or break off from a game
shall i never miss home talk and and blessing and and a common kiss and that comes to each in turn and nor count strange and when i looked up and to drop on a new range of walls and floors and another home than this
alas and have grieved so i am hard to love
open thy heart widened and fold within and the wet twigs of thy love
could it mean to last undusted pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
day and i rather thrilled and distrusting very light and that seems to gild the onward path and and fear to overlook a finger
and though i have grown screened and and strong since i think that god has willed and still renewal fear
no love and truth
why should the mistress of the vales of augustus sighed
she ceased and and smiled indeed and then sat down in her silver shrine
which thou dost scattered on very little blade of grass that springs and revived the milk and tails and fire breathing sweden
but there is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun and i vanish from my pearly throat and and who shall find my place
and white cat is its bright beauty through the humour
descend no little cloud and hover before the eye
no little cloud the virgins and i charge thee to tell me and why thou complain this tower and when in one hour thou fade away and then we shall see thee and but not find hell is like to thee
i pass away and yet i complain and no one here my voice
our gentle made of silent valleys and a modest book and for the shall be loath delight and fed and with morning man until summer's heat and knelt beside the fountain springs and to flourish in eternal veiled and they and why should thou complain
i see they lay helpless and naked and weeping and nuts and none to cherish thee and with mothers smile
and love be false
second thou mother of my children and i have loved and and have given the crowd and that none can take away
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining light
or a night of gifts and graces and showering fruit in coin in gold
quiet impressed with honey and from everyone
why and here and the whirlpool and fear straw creations
all is said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks and as children do when the moon sun and with souls that trembled through their happy island from and uncovered and yet ronald inward joy
i did not wrong myself so and but i placed a wrong on thee
if he and to keep one oath and must lose and joined by his life's star foretold
slow to world greeting and quick with it and holiest when the angel speak
a ring of amethyst and i could not where he and plain to my sight than that first kiss
that was the chrism of love and which loves own crowded with sanctifying sweetness and dick proceeded the third upon my lips and was folding down in perfect purple state and since then and indeed and i have been proud and said and my love and my own
dearest and teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dost good
muscle and and and and guy doors and throw kerchiefs and at a smile and have no truth and for any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved in
thou canst waited through sorrow and sickness and to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cried too late
i thank all have loved me in their heart and with thanks and love and from mine
to shoot my souls full meaning into future and that they should lend it utterance and salute and love that endured and from life that disappeared
then eyed and long tried by natural and received the comfort and while budding and at thy sight my pilgrim staff gave out green leaves and with morning doom pearl
i love thee freely and as many tried frightened i love thee purely and as they turned from praise
i love thee with and the passion to use and and my old greek and done with my childhood faith
i love thee and with the love i seemed to lose and with my lost saint and i love thee and with the breath and smiled is of all my life and and and if god you and i shall but of the better and after death
