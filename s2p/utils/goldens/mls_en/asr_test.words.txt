names do you i tell you bertie it hit me hard at first very hard what hit you i simply couldn't follow the blighter charlotte's calculated callousness oh
however it seems our only chance so long not being one of the official stewards i had my choice of churches next morning and naturally i didn't hesitate the only drawback in going to lower bingley was that it was ten miles away
the odds having lengthened owing to a rumor in knowledgeable circles that the rev was subject to hay fever and was taking big chances strolling  the paddock behind the vicarage in the early mornings
what i have always said and what i always shall say is that this ante post betting is a mistake an error and a mug's game you never can tell what's going to happen
don't touch a word of it or you'll spoil the whole thing i said earnestly i am delighted to hear you say so and i shall preach the sermon without fail next sunday morning
i believe that is the technical term sir said jeeves so you had inside information dash it said young bingo why yes sir said jeeves brookfield
that's curious we've had gorgeous weather in london the birds ceased to sing what birds what the devil does it matter what birds said young bingo with some asperity any birds the birds round about here you don't expect me to specify them by their
snatched eustace away from his morning's work and instructed him to put a tenner on the twing flier at current odds for each of the syndicate and after lunch eustace rang me up to say that he had done business at a snappy seven to one
undoubtedly sir right-o then pack our spare dickey and a toothbrush in a neat brown paper parcel send a wire to lord wickhammersley to say we're coming and buy two tickets on the five ten at paddington tomorrow
he's known far and wide as a pretty hot coach for those of fairly feeble intellect well when i tell you he got me through smalls you'll gather that he's a bit of a hummer
the blighter had apparently risen with the lark leave me i said i would be alone i can't see anybody till i've had my tea when cynthia smiles said young bingo the skies are blue
steggles didn't notice it and the rev didn't notice it himself but eustace and i both spotted that he had dropped a chunk of at least half a dozen pages out of his sermon case as he was walking up to the pulpit he sort of flickered
when he got to the gap in the manuscript but carried on all right and steggles went away with the impression that twenty minutes or a bit under was his usual form the next sunday we heard tucker and starkie
reverend j j roberts fale-by-the-water receives ten minutes reverend g hayward lower bingley receives twelve minutes reverend james bates
happened to mention the contents of the note to me when he brought it we are old friends bingo registered grief anguish rage despair and resentment
very vividly sir well they're down there too reading for some exam or other with the vicar i used to read with him myself at one time
bright and early the next morning as i lay in bed blinking at the sunlight on the dressing table and wondering when jeeves was going to show up with a cup of tea a heavy weight descended on my toes and the voice of young bingo polluted the air
leave me laddie i said leave me to my fried egg directly i'd got up i went to the phone
the world takes on a roseate hue birds in the garden trill and sing and joy is king of everything when cynthia smiles
he's being offered at a hundred to six but no takers what shall we do i had to grapple with the thing for a moment in silence eustace hello what can you get on g hayward
as the medicine boy pours the prescribed pint of horse salts through the funnel inserted between the bars i hastily inquire is russell still in the ward frank how is he
he will at once secure a position and save every penny to aid in my release tacitly i concur in his ardent hope it would break his heart to be disillusioned
distraught with anxiety and yearning to see my sick friend i resolve upon a way to visit the hospital in the morning as the guard hands me the bread ration and shuts my cell i slip my hand between the sill and the door
the dampness of the cell is piercing my bones every movement racks my body with pain my eyes are tortured with the eternal white of the walls sombre shadows brood around me
there is something wrong with his legs the poor boy writes he is unable to move them and suffers great pain it can't be fever he thinks but the physician will not tell him what is the matter
tears fill my eyes as i read his despairing cry oh aleck i am so young i don't want to die he implores me to visit him
a strange longing for his companionship possesses me in the gnawing loneliness his face floats before me casting the spell of a friendly presence
he feels weak and feverish and the thoughts of being left alone in the cell in his present condition fills him with horror i send an urgent request to see the chaplain but the guard informs me that mr milligan is absent
the warden berating me for having taken advantage of my presence in the dispensary to see russell clandestinely and threatening to punish me with the dungeon
you know flem the night nurse doing a five spot for murder his father and the warden are old cronies that's how he got to be nurse
a peculiar tenderness steals into my thoughts of the boy i look forward eagerly to his notes impatiently i scan the faces in the passing line wistful for the sight of the youth and my heart beats faster at his fleeting smile
plagued and tormented in great suffering russell grows bitter and complaining the nurses and officers are persecuting him he writes they will soon do him to death if i will not come to his rescue
don't know a damn thing about it and careless as hell always makes mistakes well doc ordered an injection for russell now don't ever say i told you
i plead with him for permission to visit the sick boy who is hungry for a friendly presence and constantly calling for me apparently touched by my emotion the captain yields
it is the boy's dying wish it will ease his last hours the captain refers me to the inspectors but mr reed informs me that it would be subversive of discipline to grant my request
your friend russell i know who you mean i'm sorry for the boy he is paralyzed all right but no it can't be why frank it was just a chill and a little weakness
for an instant i am speechless with terror no it it cannot be some mistake frank i mean young schroyer from the construction shop he's number two six oh eight
perhaps he got into a fight in the shop in the dungeon now he'll lose his commutation time unable to bear the suspense i am about to appeal to the chaplain when a friendly runner surreptitiously hands me a note
but several days pass and still no reply from captain wright finally i pretend severe pains in the bowels to afford frank the doctor's assistant an opportunity to pause at my cell
his strong features softened by sorrow his eyes grown large with the same sweet sadness of little felipe
two the passing weeks and months bring no break in the dreary monotony the call of the robin on the river bank rouses no echo in my heart no sign of awakening spring brightens the constant semi-darkness of the solitary
he is not expected at the office till the following week i prevail upon the kindly mitchell recently transferred to the south block to deliver a note to the warden in which i appeal on behalf of russell
he will permit me to visit russell he informs me on condition that a guard be present at the meeting for a moment i hesitate the desire to see my friend struggles against the fear of irritating him by the sight of the hated uniform
maybe the setting sun will steal a glance upon me for hours i stand with naked breast close to the bars i must not miss a friendly ray it may suddenly peep into the cell and turn away from me unseen in the gloom
but the officers and the convict nurses accuse him of shamming to evade work they threaten to have him returned to the shop and he implores me to have the chaplain intercede for him
what russell he asks indifferently russell schroyer put four days ago under observation oh that poor kid why he is paralyzed
he looks pale and haggard the old buoyant step now languid and heavy a tone of apprehension pervades his notes he is constantly harassed by the officers he writes his task has been increased he is nervous and weak
pious john the rangeman is unsympathetic he still bears me ill will from the days of the jail only young russell still remembers me
but in the morning the medicine boy confirms my worst fear the doctor has said the boy will die russell does not realize the situation
the boy is jubilant and full of vitality within three months he will breathe the air of freedom a note of sadness at leaving me behind permeates his communications but he is enthusiastic over his project of aiding me to liberty
the look of mute joy on the agonized face subdues the excruciating pain in my hand oh dear aleck he whispers i'm so glad they let you come i'll get well if you'll nurse me
but the warden curtly refuses my plea remarking that it is dangerous to permit me to associate with the men i suggest the chaplain for the mission or some prisoner selected by the authorities but this offer is also vetoed
late at night frank appears at my cell he looks very grave as he whispers aleck you must bear up russell yes aleck worse tell me frank
thereupon i ask permission to arrange a collection among the prisoners russell firmly believes that he would improve in outside hospital and the pardon board might grant the petition
letters from my comrades have become rare and irregular they sound strangely cold and impersonal the life of the prison is also receding no communication reaches me from my friends
for three days every morning and afternoon i anxiously scrutinize the faces of the passing men but russell is not among them his absence torments me with a thousand fears may be the warden has renewed his inquisition of the boy
my words seem to soothe my friend and he grows more cheerful when unexpectedly he learns the truth from the wrangling nurses his notes grow piteous with misery
in my utter isolation the world outside appears like a faint memory unreal and dim the deprivation of newspapers has entirely severed me from the living
eagerly every day i anticipate his mute greeting as he passes in the line this morning i saw him hold up two fingers the third crooked in the sign of the remaining two and a stump a joyous light in his eyes his step firmer more elastic
if only i had the birds i should find solace in their thoughtful eyes dick and sis would understand and feel with me but my poor little friends have disappeared only russell remains my only friend
i pass the night in anguish clutching desperately at the faint hope that it cannot be some mistake perhaps frank has exaggerated
the kindly frank is sympathetic every day he passes notes between us and i try to encourage russell he will improve i assure him his time is short and fresh air and liberty will soon restore him
by tacit permission of the friendly medicine boy i pass to the second floor where the wards are located and quickly steal to russell's bedside
the shadow of death is in his eyes the body exudes decomposition bereft of speech i gently press his white emaciated hand the weary eyes close
how sorrowful he looks now he is gone the hours are weary with silence and solitude listlessly i turn to the pages of my library book
but in the afternoon he is missing from the line with sudden apprehension i wonder at his absence could i have overlooked him in the closely walking ranks it is barely possible
the days of terrible anxiety incident to the tunnel project my heart goes out to the faithful boy whose loyalty and discretion have so much aided the safety of my comrades
and the boy falls into slumber silently i touch his dry lips and steal away in the afternoon i appeal to the warden to permit me to nurse my friend
he is so tender-hearted his correspondence is full of sympathy and encouragement and he strives to cheer me with the good news another day is gone his sentence is nearing its end
and now the solitary is once more bleak and cold as his release approaches the tone of native confidence becomes more assertive in russell's letter
if i could only come to nurse him he is sure he would improve he distrusts the convict attendants who harry and banter the country lad their heartless abuse is irritating the sick boy beyond patience
i long for a bit of sunshine i wait patiently at the door perhaps it is clear to-day my cell faces west
look here aleck i know you're square and you can keep a secret all right i'll tell you something if you won't give me away yes yes frank what is it
with an involuntary cry i withdraw my maimed and bleeding fingers the overseer conducts me to the dispensary
or maybe the astral aura of my beloved uncle maxim bringing warmth and hope sweet conceit of oriental thought barren of joy in life the sun is fading it feels chilly in the twilight
flem got the wrong bottle gave the poor boy some acid in the injection paralyzed the kid he did the damn murderer
there is no hope frank reports decomposition has already set in the boy is in terrible agony he is constantly crying with pain and calling for me
if he could go to an outside hospital he is sure to recover every evening frank brings sadder news russell is feeling worse he is so nervous the doctor has ordered the nurses to wear slippers
i shall not see him when he returns to the cell at noon the line passes on the opposite side of the hall but in the afternoon when the men are again unlocked for work i shall look into his eyes for a happy moment and perhaps the dear boy will have a message for me
i tremble for the reckless boy as i hear his low cough apprising me of the stiff he unerringly shoots between the bars while the double file of prisoners marches past my door
the doors in the ward have been lined with cotton to deaden the noise of slamming but even the sight of a moving figure throws russell into convulsions
now a bright beam plays on my neck and shoulders and i press closer to the door to welcome the dear stranger he caresses me with soft touch perhaps it is the soul of little dick pouring out his tender greeting in this song of light
exasperated by the taunts of the night nurse russell yesterday threw a saucer at him he was reported to the doctor who threatened to send the paralyzed youth to the dungeon
perhaps he has remained in his cell not feeling well it may be nothing serious he will surely be in the line tomorrow
friendless prisoners are often allowed to circulate subscription lists among the inmates and two years previously i had collected a hundred and twenty-three dollars for the pardon of a lifetimer
he is dead bear up aleck his last thought was of you he was unconscious all afternoon but just before the end it was nine thirty three he sat up in bed so suddenly he frightened me
and his health is declining in the broken sentences i sense some vague misgiving as of impending calamity
with intense thankfulness i think of russell again i live through the hopes and fears that drew us into closer friendship
with difficulty i recognize my friend's bold handwriting in the uneven nervous scrawl russell is in the hospital at work in the shop he writes he had suffered a chill the doctor committed him to the ward for observation
but i cannot expose the dying youth to this indignity and pain angered by my refusal perhaps disappointed in the hope of learning the secret of the tunnel from the visit the warden forbids me hereafter to enter the hospital
and on his head a steel cap he did wear of colour rusty brown but sure and strong and in his hand an huge poleaxe did bear whose steel was iron studded but not long with which he wont to fight to justify his wrong
her face was ugly and her mouth distort foaming with poison round about her gills in which her cursed tongue full sharp and short
to throw amongst the good which others had just brought these two now had themselves combined in one and linked together against sir artegally for whom they waited as his mortal phone
yet the huge stroke which he before intended kept on his course as he did it direct and with such monstrous poise adown descended that seemed naught could him from death protect
and then turning unto him and you sir knight said she that taken have this toilsome pain for wretched woman miserable white may you in heaven immortal guerdon gain for so great travel as you do sustain for other mead may hope for none of me to whom nought else but bare life doth remain
and eke himself did threaten to confound began to burn in rage and freeze in fear doubting sod end of principle on sound yet simply heard but one that did appear he did himself encourage and take better cheer
thereto he had great skill in single fight his face was ugly and his countenance stern that could have frayed one with the very sight and gaped like a gulf when he did gerne that whether man or monster one could scarce discern
but now aread sir sergis how long space hath he her lent a champion to provide ten days quoth he he granted hath of grace for that he weaneth well before that tide none can have tidings to assist her side for all the shores which to the sea accost
all be that it most safety to him gave and much did magnify his noble name for from the day that he thus did it leave amongst all knights he blotted was with blame and counted but a recreant knight with endless shame
but with such force and fury violent the tyrant thundered his thick blows so fast that through the iron walls their way they rent and even to the vital parts they passed ne ought could them endure but all they cleft or brassed
some clarkes do doubt in their deviceful art whether this heavenly thing whereof i treat to weeten mercy be of justice part or drawn forth from her by divine extreet
the other held a snake with venom fraught on which he fed and gnawed hungrily as if that long she had not eaten ought that round about her jaws one might descry the bloody gore and poison dropping loathsomely
and now they do so sharply him assay that they his shield in pieces battered have and forced him to throw it quite away fro dangers dread his doubtful life to save
and all the people both of town and land which there stood gazing from the cities wall upon these warriors greedy to understand to whether should the victory befall now when they saw it fall they eke him greeted all
that the gore blood thence gushing grievously did underneath him like a pond appear and all his armor did with purple dye thereat he brayed loud and yelled dreadfully
if that he were the same who all that wrong unto that woeful dame so long had done and from her native land exiled her that all the world fake shame he boldly answered him he there did stand that would his doings justify with his own hand
he will not bide the danger of such dread but strikes his sails and vereth his mainsheet and lends unto it leave the empty air to beat
now rise again at this your joyous sight already seems that fortunes headlong wheels begins to turn and some to shine more bright then it was want through comfort of this noble knight
which when the prince heard tell his heart gan earn for great desire that monster to assay and prayed the place of her abode to learn which being showed he gan himself straight way there to address and his bright shield display
yet when as fit advantage he did spy the whiles the cursed felon high did rear his cruel hand to smite him mortally under his stroke he to him stepping near right in the flank him stroke with deadly drear
for what so ever good by any said or done she heard she would straightways invent how to deprave or slanderously upbraid or to misconstrue of a man's intent and turn to ill the thing that well was meant
but turn we now to noble artegall who having left mercilla straight way went on his first quest the which him forth did call
but by her tempered without grief or gall till strong constraint did her thereto enforce and yet even then ruining her willful fall with more then needful natural remorse and yielding the last honour to her wretched coarse
whom they by slights allured and to their purpose led such were these hags and so unhandsome dressed who when they nigh approaching had espied sir artegall returned from his late quest they both arose and at him loudly cried
ne'ertheless said he dear lady with me go someplace shall us receive and harbour yield if not we will it force maugre your foe
so also did this monster use like slight to many a one which came into her school whom she did put to death deceived like a fools
now turn again sir artegall then said for if i live till those ten days have end assure yourself sir knight she shall have aid though i this dearest life for her do spend
this well l wrote that fare she is as great and meriteth to have as high a place sit in the almighties everlasting seat she first was bred and borne of heavenly race from thence poured down on men by influence of grace
so much more than is that of power and art that seeks to save the subject of her skill yet never doth from doom of right depart as it is greater praise to save than spill and better to reform than to cut off the ill
would have embraced her with heart entire but she back starting with disdainful ire bade him avaunt and he would unto his lore allured be for prayer nor for meed
shut up her haven marred her merchants' trade robbed her people that full rich had been and in her neck a castle huge had made the which did her command without needing persuade
her hands were foul and dirty never washed in all her life with long nails overwrought like puttockes claws with th'one of which she scratched her cursed head although it itched naught
who for like cause faire beige did opprese and right and wrong most cruelly confound and so be now grantorto who no less then all the rest burst out to all outrageousness
with so foul blame as breach of faith once plight or change of love for any worlds delight is ought on earth so precious or so dear as praise and honour
her name was height detraction and her dwelling was near to envy even her neighbour next a wicked hag and envy self excelling in mischief for herself she only vexed but this same both herself and others eke perplexed
so did the faerie knight himself abeare and stouped oft his head from shame to shield no shame to stoupe ones head more high to rear and much to gaine and little for to yield so stoutest knights do oftentimes in field
which when the lady from the castle saw where she with her two sons did looking stand she towards him in her haste herself did draw to greet him the good fortune of his hand
much was the lady in her gentle mind abashed at this rebuke that bit her near ne ought to answer there unto did find but hanging down her head with heavy cheer stood long amazed as she amated weer
she coming forth when as she first beheld the armed prince with shield so blazing bright her ready to assail was greatly quelled and much dismayed with that dismayful sight that back she would have turned for great affright
whom now her keepers had forsaken quite to save themselves and scattered were abrode her half dismayed they found in doubtful plight as neither glad nor sorry for their sight yet wondrous fair she was and richly clad in royal robes and many jewels dight
long while he tugged and strove to get it out and all his power applied thereunto that he therewith the knight drew all about nonetheless for all that ever he could do his axe he could not from his shield undo
soon as he did within the lists appear with dreadful look he artegall beheld as if he would have daunted him with fear and grinning griesly did against him weld his deadly weapon which in hand he held
horrible hideous and of hellish race born of the brooding of echidna face or other like infernal furies kind for of a maid she had the outward face to hide the horror which did lurk behind the better to beguile whom she so fond to find
with thus aloud she gan to bray and yell and foul blasphemous speeches forth did cast and bitter curses horrible to tell that even the temple wherein she was plast did quake to hear and nigh asunder breast
then all the rest which in that castle were seeing that sad ensample them before darest not abide but fled away for fear and then conveyed out at a postern door long sought the prince but when he found no more to oppose against his power he forth issued
whereof when news was to that tyrant brought how that the ladie beige now had found a champion that had with his champion fought and laid his senefchall low on the ground
as for grandtorto him with treachery and trains having surprised he foully did to die there too the blatant beast by them set on at him began aloud to bark and bay with bitter rage and fell contention
who then can thee mercilla thoroughly praise that herein dost all earthly princes pass what heavenly muse shall thy great honour raise up to the skies whence first derived it was
so backward he at once with him did wend though as they rode together on their way a rout of people they before them kend flocking together in confused array as if that there were some tumultuous affray
it often falls in course of common life that right long time is overborne of wrong through avarice or power or guile or strife that weakens her and makes her party strong
amongst the which then fortuned to be the noble briton prince with his brave peer who when he none of all those knights did see hastily bent that enterprise to hear nor undertake the same for coward fear
during all which those knights continued there both doing and receiving courtesies of that great lady who with goodly cheer them entertained fit for their dignities
and huge great beast it was when it in length was stretched forth that nigh filled all the place and seemed to be of infinite great strength
but that some life remained secretly and as he passed afore withouten dread bit him behind that long the mark was to be read then the other coming near began him revile and foully rail with all she could invent
that sought with lawless power him to oppress and bring in bondage of their brutishness and far away amid their rakehell bands they spied a lady left all succourless crying and holding up her wretched hands to him for aid
there eke he placed a strong garrisone and set a senechall of dreaded might that by his power oppressed every one and vanquished all ventrous knights in fight
which message when grantorto heard full fain and glad he was the slaughter so to stay and pointed for the combat twixt them twain the morrow next ne gave him longer day so sounded the retreat and drew his folk away
and that so wretched one as ye do see is like her lingering death then loathed life to be much was he moved with her piteous plight and low dismounting from his lofty steed gone to recomfort her all that he might seeking to drive away deep rooted dreed
to which as they approached the cause to know they saw a knight in dangerous distress of a rude route him chasing to and fro
he stepped forth with courage bold and great admired of all the rest in presence there and humbly gan that mighty queen entreat to grant him that adventure for his former feat
gainst which the pallid death finds no defense but all in vain their numbers are so great that naught may boot to banish them from thence for soon as he their outrage back doth beat they turn afresh and oft renew their former threat
the prince stayed not his answer to devise but opening straight the spar forth to him came full nobly mounted in right warlike wise and asked him
so to the church he came where it was told the monster underneath the altar lay there he that idol saw of mossy gold most richly made but there no monster did behold
for if that virtu be of so great might which from just verdict will for nothing start but to preserve in violated right oft spills the principal to save the part
with hope of help in that her greatest need so thence he wished her with him to wend unto some place where they both rest and feed and she take comfort which god now did send good heart in evils doth the evils much an end
therefore she used often to resort to common haunts and companies frequent to hark what any one did good report to blot the same with blame or rest in wicked sort
that it the postern did from closing stay and whiles the prince hard pressed in between and entrance won straight the other fled away and ran into the hall where he did ween himself to save but he there slew him at the screen
how they might make him into mischief fall for freeing from their snares irena thrall besides unto themselves they gotten had a monster which the blatant beast men call a dreadful fiend of gods and men
though with her huge long tail she at him struck that made him stagger and stand half aghast with trembling joints as he for terror shook who naught was terrified but greater courage
much like in foulness and deformity unto that monster whom the theban knight the father of that fatal progeny made kill herself for very hearts despite that he had read her riddle which no wight could ever loose but suffered deadly duel
and now on earth itself enlarged has from the utmost brink of the armericke shore unto the margent of the molucas those nations farre thy justice doe adore but thine owne people doe thy mercy prayse much more
that night sir artegall did cause his tent there to be pitched on the open plain for he had given straight commandment that none should dare him once to entertain which none durst break though many would right fain for fair irena whom they loved dear
but witness unto me ye heavens that know how clear i am from blame of this upbraid for ye into like thraldome me did throw and kept from accomplishing the faith which i did owe
and her long tail and feathers strongly shook that all the temple did with terror fill yet him nought terrified that feared nothing ill
striving long time in vain it to withstand yet glad at last to make most base submission and life enjoy for any composition so now he hath new laws and orders new imposed on it with many a hard condition
of stature huge and hideous he was like to a giant for his monstrous height and did in strength most sorts of men surpass ne ever any found his match in might
he day and night doth ward both far and wide that none can there arrive without an host to her he deems already but a damned ghost
but yet old sergis did so well him pain that from closest friends that dar'd not to appear he did all things purvay which for them needful were.
that the bold prince was forced foot to give to his first rage and yield to his despite the wildest of him so dreadfully he drive that seemed a marble rock asunder could have rive
that all the woods and rocks nigh to that way began to quake and tremble with dismay and all the air rebellowed again so dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray and evermore those hags themselves did pain to sharpen him
and eagle's wings for scope and speediness that nothing may escape her reaching might whereto she ever lifts to make her hardy flight
then to his first emprise his mind he lent full loath to belgce and to all the rest of whom yet taking leave thenceforth he went and to his former journey him addressed on which long way he rode ne ever day did rest
saying that he had with unmanly guile and foul abusion both his honour blent and that bright sword the sword of justice lent had stained with reproachful cruelty in guiltless blood of many an innocent
unto that lady where he her had lore and her gan cheare with what she there had viewed and what she had not seen within unto her showed
and purchase it to us with spear and shield and if all fail yet farewell open field the earth to all her creatures lodging lends with such his cheerful speeches he doth wield her mind so well that to his will she bends and binding up her locks and weeds forth with him wins
unto a stranger's love so lightly placed for gifts of gold or any worldly glee to leave the love that ye before embraced and let your fame with falsehood be defaced
and now he hath to her prefixed a day by which if that no champion do appear which will her cause in battailous array against him justify and prove her clear of all those crimes that he against her doth rear she death shall by
which cruel outrage when as artegall did well advise thenceforth with weary heed he shunned his strokes wherever they did fall and way did give unto their graceful speed as when a skillful mariner doth reed a storm approaching that doth peril threat
much more it praised was of those two knights the noble prince and righteous artegall when they had seen and heard her doom arights against duessa damned by them all
then thus replied now sure and by my life too much am i to blame for that fair maid that have her drawn to all this troublous strife through promise to afford her timely aide which by default i have not yet frayed
appeared like asps sting that closely kills or cruelly does wound whom so she wills a distaffe in her other hand she held upon the which she little spins but spills and fains to weave false tales and leasings bad
but belge with her sons prostrated low before his feet in all that peoples sight 'mongst joys mixing some tears 'mongst wele some woe him thus bespake oh most redoubted knight the which hast me of all most wretched white that earst was dead restored to life again
carlos duke of alva with smiling lips and sinister eyes greeted her with the suave courtesy which was so characteristic of his race and class he typified the worst of the spanish folk even as the young girl did the best
the duke was a suitor of the romantic school each phrase was studied each attitude as obviously planned as a military campaign it was a method which had invariably succeeded
nothing which i could not crush had many a man made this speech he would have punctuated its termination with a clenched fist
however the speech and the theatrical delivery of the gifted courtier were wasted effort maria theresa of spain was impervious to the surface sheen she had seen true metal within the past twenty-four hours
the air was stifling yet the foresight of cutting the holes gave him enough oxygen to maintain his senses at last after eons of suffering which reminded him of nothing so much as his initiation into the college fraternity
as the door slammed the top of the trunk was slowly lifted and the battered bleeding face of warren jarvis might have been visible above the iron ridge of its lock bar stiffly he drew himself out of the trunk to blink in the unaccustomed light
as she hurried to the door she pulled her taut nerves together there on the threshold was her kinsman nita had been right as usual in her sharp way
ah how i dread telling you i was there a few days before leaving for america i learned unfortunately that despite my very friendly advice he had been prowling about that ridiculous old castle again
at last with the aid of an extravagant largesse she was conducted to her staterooms as she entered the parlor of her luxurious suite the first sight which caught her eye was the trunk inverted
ah i'm most all here he looked down at his twisted cracked patent leather shoes my feet are bent
but today her only anxiety was to find her elusive quarters for the strange cruise to learn whether or not her new knight-errant was alive or dead from the rigors of his escape
that's all right you may place it later but you might fix it right side up the steward turned it as the girl breathed a sigh of relief i'm so sorry ma'am i hope the contents are not upset i hope not anything else ma'am no not now steward
that young woman was busy studying the handsome features of the ingratiating bedroom steward so engrossed was she that she stumbled over the elevated sill of the door from the promenade deck
with hands stretched tensely against the corners of the trunk he warded off as best he could the shocks of the skilled baggage breakers along the route
as a keen student to physiognomy the mental attitude of the duke of alva would have been an open book to maria theresa loyal to family and countrymen he was the symbol of her own strata in spain
my dear maria why do you not desist from this silly pursuit of an imaginary treasure what is the value of money we are spaniards not shirt-sleeved mercenary pigs of americans
if you want anything maam there is the telephone i'll place your trunk if you please ma'am he started to drag the trunk to the side of the cabin but the princess intervened
in search of the mythical treasure your grandfather is supposed to have secreted there he laughed and the girl instinctively shuddered with a newborn distrust there was no mirth in the sound
what are you doing on the mauretania why did you leave spain carlos as he shut the door he smiled and now her intuition warned her of the cunning which lurked behind those pleasantly curving lips
carlos exclaimed the princess fair cousin if i but knew you were as pleased as you are surprised at seeing me with the words he advanced and kissed her cold fingertips with old world punctiliousness
she turned away impatiently and walked toward the cabin porthole oh come carlos the ship is almost in midstream let us go out on deck for one last look at america thank you i can do very well without it he retorted as he sat down upon the trunk
carlos here how could he be i wonder and the princess fumbled with her keys until she found the right one she opened the trunk with a trembling hand and began to raise the cover a quiver in her voice are you all right mr jarvis
but your location is good you'll find the mauretania as steady as a parish church here is the clothes press ma'am and the other rooms are off there it's quite the finest suite on the boat ma'am the steward looked about ingratiatingly then he turned toward the door

he led our powers bore the commission of my place and person the which immediacy may well stand up and call itself your brother not so hot in his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition
and in the lot i saw some tools mighty like these boys wow and again i say wow murmured giraffe thieves tools hey grunted bumpus pushing forward to handle some of the shiny articles himself perhaps now one of these here might be what they call a jimmy and another a centerbit
such men would never come up here to camp out or to hunt only one thing would be apt to tempt them to dive into the woods like this they expected to be hunted and are on the way to the canada border as fast as they can pack
we opened the bag and guessed what the tools must have been thrown away by some yeggmen who were making a bolt across country for the canada border remarked thad as the three officers sat down close to the fire to warm their hands
here's a print all right that seems altogether different from any of ours i can show you that the shoe has been patched across the toe and none of ours have such a mark it's a fresh print too and that means the man who made it must have been here since that rainstorm is that clear enough for you boys
and the first thing i'm going to do is to find out if there is any track here different from ours if i find that i'll be pretty sure it was made by others who camped here within the last night or two
my father is dead mr green but mother is fairly well replied the boy with a sad tone in his voice we are not living in maine any longer but down in new york state where all these other scouts belong but will you drink that coffee if we make a pot for you
but few people ever knew it because he was called bumpus by young and old alike it was a little after the nooning hour the boys had evidently been paddling part of the morning
a sheriff's posse of course everybody did as they were told and when they afterwards exchanged opinions regarding the ridiculous character of the picture they must have made with six boys and two men trying to see who could elevate his hands the highest they must always laugh until the tears rolled down their cheeks
poor smithy poor bob exclaimed the one who had called himself davy jones there were six of them in all and it was easy to see from the various parts of the khaki uniforms that were in evidence these lads belonged to a section of the boy scouts organization
and that's just what's what responded the sheriff nodding as he examined the contents of the bag we hope to get them in time because it meant means a cool thousand to us perhaps more because the reward may have been doubled after we hit the woods sometimes we've been hot on the track and then again they'd give us the slip and we'd lose ground
i've often wished we had dogs along but they're hard to find and people somehow don't like to see dogs up here since the law put a ban on deer hounding i'd like to keep just one of them tools to remember my find by if you didn't have any objection suggested step hen anxiously
somehow all of the scouts just took it for granted that these three advancing parties must surely be the men of whom they had been talking the fleeing desperate rascals who had lately robbed a bank and were trying to make the border so that they might cross over into canada from which territory they would be able to make faces at any pursuers
you want to go slow my boy about handling things that you never saw before i wouldn't like to say what would have happened to the lot of you once this dropped into that red-hot fire many a fool miner has been blown to atoms because he tried to dry damp dynamite out in an oven
how do you reckon they got here allan by boat or through the woods up direct asked thad as though he had himself been pondering over that question without being able to connect as yet let's take a look along the edge of the river remarked the maine boy
one canoe carried besides thad and step hen a dark-faced quiet fellow who was really a full blooded penobscot indian and of course named sebattis as nearly all of them seem to be
the second was given over to allan and davy jones with a young guide named jim hasty who by the way was about as slow and deliberate as anyone could be and the third boat had for a crew a real maine character eli crookes about as straight as a pine tree giraffe and bumpus
observed giraffe also getting to his feet for he was more or less interested in any demonstration of woodcraft that applied to boy scout knowledge of course i know that what the footprint of every one of us looks like even to our guides began allan because i've made it my business to keep my eyes around
but go on stephen finish the story while you're about it why of course when thad he found he could go that gave him an idea and sure enough the whole of the patrol got the fever bob quail had to give it up because he had too much on hand to leave home just then
but bumpus was in deadly earnest he gripped the sides of the canoe just as he had seen davy do and then giving a flirt into the air started to extend his dumpy lower limb upward
when i was down to new york with my dad last year he had to see the police commissioner about a little business and they were old friends too i went along and sat there in one of the offices nigh an hour to amuse myself i examined the heaps of queer things they had there which i reckoned had been taken from all sorts of crooks that'd been arrested for years
who knew more or less about what to do in the woods and what not to do because you see they seemed to get up this far all right what if there was a big reward out for their capture and we managed to crowd the bunch to the wall suggested bumpus enviously
they've led us a lively chase up to now but the longer we're held off the more determined we become to follow them night and day till we bring the lot to bay they've got mighty little grub along and we don't want to let em have any time to hunt then perhaps hunger will help us out
so once more they walked after allan who was soon examining the shore up close to the edge of the water there's a mark you can all see that looks as if a boat had been pulled up but it's old and faint the rain has nearly washed it out do any of you glimpse signs of another scratch that's fresher
eyes on the print of his hunting shoe or boot if he wears such instead of moccasins but stop and remember bumpus we had a heavy rain day before yesterday that must have passed over this section as well as where we struck it after that it turned cold
and deliver the message and his guardian fell in with the idea right away didn't he thad i think he was only too willing boys because he knew we wanted to get up in maine the worst kind ever since our comrade allan hollister here began to tell us such splendid stories of the fun to be had in the pine woods of his home state
because the feet are the first part of the body to feel cold when during sleep the blood fails to circulate as thoroughly as when one is awake since the heart slackens its functions in order to get rested for the next day's labor
but those three maine guides were promised the easiest time of their lives since there were so many willing recruits to do the cooking and lend a hand at the paddling
allan's purpose of course was to make his chums think they were having a hand in the search then when telling the story afterwards they could say when we had hunted all along the shore
exclaimed bumpus as he tried to leap to his feet but owing to his weight this was never an easy thing for him and he did not refuse the helping hand thad stretched out so they joined allan as he stood there holding his torch near the ground what you found asked giraffe as they came up
yes he's sure struck something giraffe declared as though anxious to show what an advantage it was sometimes to be the professor of a neck that was longer than any of the others there he's beckoning to us to come on to come on over fellers
the ignorance of step hen all of them guides as well as scouts stared at the strange object which step hen was holding up looks like a little handbag of leather but it's been used a heap i reckon suggested davy jones
that's mine er i meant to say i found the same in the bushes here when i was huntin something i lost and step hen held up a little packet secured in water cloth waterproof cloth which he had evidently since discovered just where he formerly laid it down
hold on don't you think of tossing that into the fire step hen why are you crazy didn't you ever see such a thing before in your life no wonder allan there was nearly scared to death when he saw what you meant to do because step hen this stick of innocent mud as you called it is really dynamite
hear about it they'd be apt to tell you it's an old camping spot how about it men bein' here often with parties replied the older guide promptly seen hundreds of fine trout jerk outen that that pool over there
and smithy had a hard luck to get a touch of the plague that had dropped in on cranford for a visit but didn't the rest of us hit it up though i should say we did as sure as my name's davy jones well the upshot of the whole matter is that one fine day six of us left cranford bound for maine with all our camp stuff along
they must have tried to get away with some loot though and found the officers hot after them so to escape being caught they've taken to the woods but that might be jumping from the frying pan into the fire davy declared if they happened to be greenhorns now it'd be apt to go hard with them up here
i always used to read about such things in every story in the papers of a burglary down in the city davy also wanted to examine the things at close range and so they were passed around even the two guides seemed to take a deep interest in the contents of the little old black bag
these parties are all right but what i do want to know is how you came by that he pointed as he spoke at the old tool bag that was lying behind step hen and evidently he must have recognized it or else suspected what it contained
somehow the idea seemed to please the rest of the scouts and even jim and eli nodded their heads as though they quite agreed with allan after he had evolved the suggestion which likely enough would have never occurred to them
the sheriff saw that allan did not seem inclined to say anything more about his own family and so he allowed the subject to drop but he did look inquiringly at his two husky deputies who gave him affirmative as well as eager nods
and for several minutes a buzz followed as each voiced his opinion concerning the merits of the tools to accomplish such a job as breaking into a strong box of a bank
i suppose they broke open the safe in the usual way with dynamite thad remarked quietly just what they did though how you guessed it i don't see the sheriff replied we found something in the bag that told us that and thad as he spoke stepped over to the tree in the crotch of which he had placed the stick of dynamite
their parents however would not hear of such a thing and the expedition must have been wrecked on the rocks before it really started only that the boys promised to take several guides along and besides allan had informed them that by the new laws up in maine hunters were bound to employ regular licensed guides when going into the woods to render the risk of fires less probable
as he was changing some of the stuff so to give his legs more room when he took the paddle and likewise cold added giraffe who was grinning with anticipation of the fun that was coming
and did you ever see him use tools like them if you did then believe me that feller ought to a been in the lock-up that's what lock-up repeated giraffe after him and he stared at step hen as though he believed the other might be trying to play some sort of a joke that's right in the lock-up the other scout went on firmly
far in the lurch when it came to this on account of his being gifted by a bountiful nature with such an exceedingly long ostrich like appendage below his head
these fellers just came to stop over here and in the incidental place we chose for a camp that what's getting me oh that's easy replied the other with a little laugh we seemed to strike this place by accident but i reckon that if you asked eli or jim
since some city men are so careless about leaving a campfire burning when breaking up and in consequence whole districts have been burned over by the rising wind scattering the brands along the leaves and pine needles
me two declared jim grinning broadly at finding how smart this boy seemed to be there you are giraffe thad went on to say turning once more to the scout perhaps as someone said only a little while back this leader of the sprinting yeggmen was himself been camping here
finally all was quiet the night wind crooned among the trees an owl hooted to its mate but the scouts all slept calmly with not a fear of danger
rocks he ejaculated scornfully just as if he had never taken the least stock in that far-fetched theory himself what d'ye call that fellers he had thrust in a hand and was now holding something aloft the dancing light from the campfire shone upon the object which seemed to glisten like polished steel
or the river suggested giraffe with a sly glance toward bumpus who flashed him back a scornful look my opinion is fellows observed allan who thus far had not taken any part in the earnest discussion that these things might never have been lost at all oh
besides he rather fancied this maine sheriff and believed that a session in his company alongside the blazing campfire would be both pleasant and profitable as doubtless the officer could relate many things of interest to the scouts but the other shook his head
oh i forgot all about that admitted the other scout looking foolish why of course that same rain would have washed out the footprints of anybody who had camped here as long ago as four or five nights that's right allen
say do you suppose now giraffe asked that these jail birds could have cracked a crib before they took to the woods well just as like as not answered allan though we can't tell that so easy
well we've settled that part of it pretty cleverly i guess thad declared as he smiled at allan it was one of the easiest jobs i've ever tackled declared the other wonder which way they went when they left here bumpus remarked
but thad as he began to see the newcomers better when they drew nearer the fire felt relieved an idea started to flit through his active brain to the effect that after all they might not be the thieves come back for some purpose perhaps to recover possession of the little old black tool bag
just please yourselves young fellows he remarked my men look a bit peaked because we've been hitting it up at quite a warm pace and i guess now they'd enjoy a hot cup right smart
with the winter coming on perhaps no blankets along and only a little grub huh they might even wish they'd let the officers catch em three meals such as they are in jail are better than nothin to eat in the wilderness oh allan went on to say the chances are they had a feller along
who seemed to be looked up to as the leader of the scout patrol which office he really filled sure replied step hen who was stretched out comfortably by a blazing fire but we've got heaps of time for hunting besides
if so be they had a canoe we ought to be able to see where it was pulled up on the little beach down there such a mark would would stay a long time unless the water rose and i don't think that happened here not over half a foot anyhow
he took a blazing brand from the fire and began to move around the outskirts of the camp beyond the tents and the glow of the fire why does he go so far away asked bumpus because we've been walking around here so much that all chances of making any discovery would be lost replied thad and out there he may stand and show
we didn't find any fresh sign we knew that the yeggs must sure have walked all the way through the woods there was a little hustle as giraffe davy step hen and bumpus all endeavored to earn the right to include themselves in the affair after which they united in declaring that no further signs lay along the little beach
immediately giraffe set up a laugh well i declare fellers he remarked some poor old carpenter's gone and lost his kit of tools shows that step hen ain't the only loony wanderin' about in these here pine woods droppin' his things around loose and then forgettin' where he put 'em
i confess i wouldn't object myself seeing that you're so pressing the coffee pot was quickly clapped on the red coals and would soon be sending out a fragrant odor
then you think they hid em here asked step hen either that or else just tossed them away to get rid of carrying such a heavy package any longer the maine boy went on
you can keep the whole bunch if you like son answered the sheriff we don't need any such evidence against these birds if only we can ketch 'em they're carrying all the evidence we want in the shape of the entire capital of the bank they looted so slick
it's a cinch that's what allan why i'm only a tenderfoot scout but i can understand that much and i'm real glad to know it too we want to take a good look at that shoe print fellers perhaps we might want to know it again sometime step hen as he said this threw himself down on the ground and seemed to be making a mental photograph of the impression
and trying out a lot of things we've been learning scouts it was fine for our rich chum bob quail to insist on handing a big lump of coin to add to the funds contributed by our folks that put us on easy street and now here we are as happy as clams at high tide just finished our grub and pitying the fellows left behind
for there were three long canoes close by with as many men doubtless guides doing something to change the luggage so that it would allow for a more even keel during the voyage upstream
but why do you say that demanded bumpus eagerly what if mr carson did stop here five six or even seven nights ago you might run on his track you know if i did i'd know it replied allan not that i've even set
and here we are at last in the country of big game canoes guides tents and everything along we need for a month of good times or more if we want it but don't forget step hen that the one main object of the trip is to find mr james w carson interrupted the boy named thad
cranford had made a start in getting a troop together and the first patrol of eight had been formed for some time another patrol was promised by spring to be followed by others as the boys became attacked by disease and desire to learn the numerous splendid things that boy scouts find out
now you just wait and see your dutch uncle show you a stunt worth two of that careful bumpus the water's deep right here called out thad whose back happened to be turned toward the other canoe just then
but that was only the beginning giraffe there were better things still headed our way sure there were davy as luck would have it just at the same time thad brewster's guardian found that it was mighty necessary he get word to a gentleman by the name of james w carson
say we'd be fixed then for a lot more of outings wouldn't we fellers allan laughed it was so strange to hear bumpus usually the most peaceable of the entire patrol speak in so fierce a tone
if it didn't exactly wash the footprints out it would make them look faint and a trailer would soon know they were old now let me take a turn around and do the rest of you sit quiet here till i call out that i've found something
and let it get too hot before better ask yourself a few questions before you go to trying tricks with strange things will you spend the night with us mr sheriff asked thad thinking they ought to appear hospitable as everyone who goes into the great timber should be
and at the same moment three men issued from the recesses of the woods and advanced toward them all of whom held leveled guns in their hands end of chapter five
kinder familiar about your make-up he said now i know you allan hollister how's the dad and the little lady you call mother i remember her well and you too as a boy who loved to hunt and fish as well as any lad in all penobscot county
queer how that could a got in this bag ain't it whatever did them yeggmen want carryin hard mud around with em i wonder he drew his hand back evidently with the intention of throwing the article into the blaze when a hand clutched his wrist and the voice of thad a bit husky sounded close to his ear
but if you're going on right away said allan perhaps you'd let us make you some hot coffee mr green the sheriff looked keenly at him and then held out a hand seemed like that was some
he wired up to maine you remember only to learn that mr carson who was a great hunter had started into the big game country after moose with a couple of guides and wouldn't be back until late in the winter everything just worked for us seemed like remarked the boy called davy thad suggested that he be sent up to follow this party
now open her up step hen and let's see the kind of rocks it's got inside giraffe demanded whereupon step hen proceeded to cautiously test the catch of the bag finding that it would give readily he pressed it further and then drew back the jaws of the leather receptacle
but just stop and think remarked step hen presently how far this is from any town where these fellers could use their tools no wonder they hid 'em in the bushes right here the only thing they could expect to break into up here would be the game laws
and to think it should be the same sort of one that found these tools ain't that a queer case though carpenter's tools step hen went on indignantly as he held up a second and then other articles which he took from the bag did you ever watch a carpenter at work draft
step hen turned red in the face as he heard the story told of how he had just been about to throw the unknown substance into the fire when prevented the lengthy sheriff looked reproachfully toward him and remarked mildly
there i can see him stoop lower down and i wouldn't be surprised if he'd hit a footprint right away the others all craned their necks in order to see what allan was doing and of course giraffe had them left
sorry but when we're as close to the heels of our game as this we must keep on the move it requires considerable hustling to run down such a lively set as those three yeggs and charley barnes he know his business up here in the woods alright
these boys would have liked nothing better than to have come out here by themselves relying upon their knowledge of woodcraft to carry them through for several of their number were well versed in such things
marius always had two complete suits of clothes the one old for every day the other brand new for special occasions both were black he had but three shirts
aunt gillenormand made repeated attempts and sent him the sixty pistoles several times marius returned them on every occasion saying that he needed nothing
besides his father's name another name was graven in marius' heart the name is thenardier marius with his grave and enthusiastic nature surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom in his thoughts
and to bring him a little hot water every morning a fresh egg and a penny roll he breakfasted on his egg and roll his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs were dear or cheap
he owed his father's life that intrepid sergeant that had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the cannonballs at waterloo he never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them at his veneration
during all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted at times by a secret force that he possessed within himself the soul aids the body and at certain moments it raises it it is the only bird that bears up its own cage
net product year in and year out seven hundred francs he lived in it how not so badly we will explain marius occupied in the gorbeau house
he had persisted for three years expending of these explorations little money which he had laid by no one had been able to give him any news of the nardier he was supposed to have gone abroad his creditors had also sought him with less love than marius
he always did this whenever he was greatly agitated she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a fool you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same time
marius learned how all this is eaten and how such are often the only things which one has to devour at that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride
but his garments were quitting him the day came when he had no longer a coat the trousers would go next what was to be done
there are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes
but with as much assiduity and had not been able to lay their hands on him marius blamed himself and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches
it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for thenardier what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards thenardier
was a calming potion rather than a restaurant it no longer exists the proprietor had a fine nickname he was called rousseau the aquatic thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sous a day which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year
it was the only debt left him by the colonel and marius made it a matter of honor to pay it what he thought when my father lay dying on the field of battle did thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grapeshot
one develops in a certain meagre fashion which is however sufficient for life this is the mode in which the existence of marius pontmercy was arranged
noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds which are requited with no renown which are saluted with no trumpet blast life misfortune isolation abandonment poverty
because he needs love he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed and ridiculous because he was poor at the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots
one on his person the second in the commode and the third in the washerwoman's hands he renewed them as they wore out they were always ragged which caused him to button his coat to the chin
courfeyrac to whom he had on his side done some good turns gave him an old coat for thirty sous marius got it turned by some porter or other and it was a new coat
a crucible into which destiny casts a man whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god for many great deeds are performed in petty combats
to see thenardier to render thenardier some service to say to him you do not know me well i do know you here i am dispose of me this was marius sweetest and most magnificent dream
are fields of battle which have their heroes obscure heroes who are sometimes grander than the heroes who win renown firm and rare natures are thus created
he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou a debt was to him the beginning of slavery he even said to himself that a creditor is worse than a master for the master possesses only a person
now seemed insipidity and he'd nerve himself against it his face wore a sort of severe flush he was timid even to rudeness
there came a moment in marius life when he swept his own landing when he bought his sou's worth of brie cheese at the fruiterer's when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker's and purchase a loaf which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it
misery almost always a stepmother is sometimes a mother destitution gives birth to might of soul and spirit distress is the nurse of pride unhappiness is a good milk for the magnanimous
life became hard for marius it was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch he ate of that terrible inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enrage that is to say he endured great hardships and privations
if one is not on one's guard lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul he kept a jealous watch on his pride such and such a formality or action which in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to him
it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing condition hard years difficult some of them to traverse others to climb marius had not failed for a single day he had endured everything in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debts
the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs he was rich he sometimes lent ten francs to a friend courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs from him as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he had simplified matters
since that time he had made unheard of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which thenardier had disappeared marius had beaten the whole country he had gone to chelles to bondy to gourney to nogent to lagny
a door which one finds locked on one at night because one's rent is not paid the insolence of the porter and the cook shop man the sneers of neighbors humiliations dignity trampled on work of whatever nature accepted disgust bitterness despondency
sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher's shop on the corner in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him an awkward young man carrying big books under his arm
but this coat was green then marius ceased to go out until after nightfall this made his coat black as he wished always to appear in mourning he clothed himself with the night
on this cutlet which he cooked for himself he lived for three days on the first day he ate the meat on the second he ate the fat on the third he gnawed the bone
chapter two marius poor it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else it ends by becoming bearable it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself one vegetates that is to say
and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base from which the strong emerge sublime
he had passed the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him by dint of toil perseverance courage and will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year he had learned german and english thanks to
he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him from that time forth he had not put off his black garments
in spite of all this he got admitted to practice as a lawyer he was supposed to live in courfeyrac's room which was decent and where a certain number of law books backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance passed as the library required by the regulations
a terrible thing it is containing days without bread nights without sleep evenings without a candle a hearth without a fire weeks without work a future without hope a coat out at the elbows an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls
asked for a mutton cutlet paid six or seven sous for it wrapped it up in a paper put it under his arm between two books and went away it was marius
he had his letters addressed to courfeyrac's quarters when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect
gillenormand trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four pieces and threw it into the waste-basket two or three days later mademoiselle gillenormand heard her father who was alone in his room talking aloud to himself
for an annual sum of thirty francs a den minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture this furniture belonged to him he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole.
and bear him off on his shoulders and yet he owed him nothing and i who owe so much to thenardier cannot join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death and in my turn bring him back from death to life
who had a timid yet angry air who on entering removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration made a profound bow to the butcher's astonished wife
and those who in self-confidence ignore all weather prognostics are still weak enough to read them and act up to them in practical meteorology in the scientific explanation of popular weather lore and in the study of atmospheric phenomena
there was a heavy fall of hail at this time and he accounts for the diminution of dust particles by the down-rush of purer upper air which displaced the contaminated lower air
it is in no respect so splendid as the afterglow succeeding sunset but of its comparative rarity its beauty is enhanced i remember a foreglow most vividly which was seen at my manse in strathmore
and company of the state of the weather at eight o'clock every morning and analyze and arrange at the meteorological office in london for the evening's forecasts over different districts of the country
and the issue of meteorological instruments to the royal navy and mercantile marine chill weather telegraphy including the reception of telegrams thrice a day from selected stations for the preparation of the daily reports and weather forecasts
in his evidence before that commission the chairman of the council acknowledged that the great function of meteorologists is the collection of facts but the interpretation of those collected facts in a scientific manner is still in a very immature condition
i went to the room opposite to watch the sunrise for i had observed in the diary that the appearance of the sun would not be for a few minutes there were streaks of light in the east above the horizon but no colour was visible
at the lake lucerne there was an exceptional diminution of the number in the course of an hour viz from one hundred and seventy-one thousand to twenty-eight thousand in a cubic inch
followed by a rise to twenty-eight point seven without any peculiar change but in two days it fell to twenty-eight point four the lowest for years followed by a deluge of rain and a perfect hurricane for several hours while the temperature was fortunately mild
in january eighteen ninety three my bedroom window looked due west i slept with blind up on that morning i was struck just after the darkness was fading away with a slight colouring all along the western horizon
returning to scotland he continued his observation at ben nevis at kingairloch opposite appin mr rankin using the instrument at the top of the mountain
but glorious and educating and inspiring as is the sunrise in itself in many cases there is occasionally something very remarkable that is connected with it rare is it but how charming when witnessed though till very recently it was all but unexplained this is the
the farmer and the sailor do not like the sight they depend so much on a favourable weather conditions of course sunrise to the aesthetic observer has always its charms the powerful king of day rejoices as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber as he steps upon the earth over the dewy mountain tops
these observations showed in general that on the mountain southerly southeasterly and easterly winds were more impregnated with dust particles sometimes containing one hundred and thirty three thousand per cubic inch northerly winds brought pure air
it is from similar maps that forecasts of storms are still framed and suitable warnings issued and a mass of information is being collected by telegraph from sixty stations in the british islands
selected by the royal society it employs a staff of over forty the chief departments relate to one ocean meteorology including the collection tabulation and discussion of meteorological data from british ships the preparation of ocean weather charts
a government commission which sat last year under the rt hon sir herbert maxwell have issued a report recommending a number of changes in the management and constitution to meteorological office and considerable modifications are not unlikely to take place in the near future
the low flying of the swallows betokens rain as well as any unseasonable dancing of midges in the evening sore corns on the feet and rheumatism in the joints are direful precursors the leaves are all a-tremble before the approach of thunder
who in innocent pleasure desire to live as much as possible in open air very little credit is given to the gas of isolated weather prophet but those who have confidence in the usual weather forecasts at the meteorological office are satisfied in their belief
in summer and autumn harvest forecasts are issued by telegraph to individuals who will defray the cost the office also collects climatological data from a number of voluntary and some subsidised stations
the beauteous robes of heaven aslant the dew bright earth and coloured air he looks in boundless majesty abroad touching the green leaves all atremble with gold light
the meteorological office westminster entirely distinct from the royal meteorological society is administered by a council chairman sir r strachey scottish member dr buchan
the general deductions which he made from his numerous observations during these two years are that one ere coming from inhabited districts is always impure
on looking about he found that the direction of the wind had changed bringing down the purer upper air to the place of observation the bending downwards of the trees by the strong wind showed that it was coming from the upper air
to foretell with any degree of certainty the state of the weather for twenty-four hours is of immense advantage to business men tourists fishermen and many others
five high humidity causes great thickness of the atmosphere if accompanied by a great amount of dust whereas there is no evidence that humidity alone has any effect in producing thickness six and there is generally a high amount of dust with high temperature
it is admitted by the best british meteorologists that the observations of the united states are better conducted although the best instruments in the world are set and registered at kew in england

that hectic flush slight yet well marked which was deepening in the western heavens had no counterpart in the east except the colourless light which marked the wintry sun's near approach
the work of weather forecasts and storm warnings is carried on with the highest degree of promptitude and efficiency at the washington central office this is because the work of predictions has been hitherto the chief work of the office
but throughout this volume i have given many illustrations but one of the largest and most important practical problems of meteorology is to ascertain the course which storm follow
and the causes by which that course is determined so that a forecast may thereby be made not only of the certain approach of a storm but a particular direction and force of the storm the method of conducting this large inquiry most effectively was devised by the french astronomer le verrier
this was accounted for by a thick haze which rendered the lower alps scarcely visible the upper limit of the haze was well defined and though the sky was cloudless the sun looked like a harvest moon and required no eagle's eye to keep fix in it
is the explanation i have not space enough to repeat the explanation given already in the last chapter of the glorious phenomenon of the afterglow but the explanation is similar
became more life-like as the cheeks flush there was rare warmth in a winter morning to cheer the half-despairing soul tired after long hours of oil reading and pierced to the heart by never ceasing rhymes yet i could not understand it
the observations at sea level showed a certain parallelism to those on the summit of the mountain with a northwesterly wind the dust particles reached the low number of three hundred per cubic inch the lowest recorded at any low level station
between one period of excess or deficiency of warmth and the next accompanied by opposite relative condition of moisture all are familiar with the hoisting of cone warning as indication of a coming storm this work is exceedingly important especially for those connected with sea by business or pleasure
little attention has been paid to foreglows compared with afterglows either with regard to their natural beauty or their weather forecasting but either the ordinary red cloud surroundings at sunrise or the western foreglow at rarer intervals betokens to the weather prophet wet and gloomy weather
the first order stations include valentia falmouth kew and aberdeen these have self-recording instruments of high precision giving a continuous record of the meteorological elements

this was the condition of the problem when sir g b airy took it up in eighteen fifty three he however was able to throw an entirely new light upon the matter
and if it was an eclipse at all the circumstances of totality placed beyond serious doubt in the same year as that in which according to the common account
at the moment of its departure the sun suddenly quitted its place in the heavens and disappeared though there were no clouds in sight and the day was quite clear
plutarch in his life of pelopidas relates how one alexander of pherae had devastated several cities of thessaly and that as soon as the oppressed inhabitants had learned that
the next day there was such an eclipse of the sun that the stars appeared everywhere in the firmament and the day was turned into night upon which agathocles's soldiers conceiving that god thereby
the spartan troops were under the command of cleombrotus the brother of leonidas the hero of thermopyl he had been consulting the oracles in sparta
arago associates the death of julius caesar in forty four b c with an annular eclipse of the sun but seemingly without sufficient warrant the actual record is to the effect that about the time of the great warrior's death there was an extraordinary dimness of the sun
the inhabitants withdrew in alarm and thus the city was captured close to this city was a pyramid of stone one plethrum in breadth two plethra in height
and therefore some change was certainly signified either to carthage which was in such a flourishing condition or to them whose affairs were in a very ruinous state
and which have been more or less completely verified by the computations and research of astronomers in modern times but these remarks do not however quite apply to the first eclipse which will be mentioned
airy thought that extremely probable that the narrative related to the total eclipse of the moon which happened on march thirteen four hundred seventy-nine b c
xenophon's allusion is to an eclipse but judging by his closing words the learned american does not seem quite satisfied with his own scepticism for he says
i should not have mentioned this matter at all but for arago's high repute as astronomer according to seneca during an eclipse a comet was also seen
zeus the father of the olympic gods turned the mid day into night hiding the light of the dazzling sun an overwhelming dread fell upon men the poet's language may evidently apply to a total eclipse of the sun
the conclusions just stated were amply confirmed as if to make assurance doubly sure airy went over his ground again testing his former conclusions with regard to the eclipse of thales by the eclipse of larissa
but as the general was on the point of marching the sun began to be eclipsed and the city was covered with darkness in the daytime this eclipse is generally identified with that of july thirteen three hundred sixty four b c
peace was accordingly agreed upon and cemented by a twofold marriage for says the historian without some strong bond there is little security to be found in men's covenants
and the sun has utterly perished from heaven and an evil gloom is overspread this was considered by old commentators to be an illusion to an eclipse and in the opinion of w w merry
the substance of these statements is that in the year three hundred and ten b c agathocles child of syracuse while conducting his fleet from syracuse to the coast of africa
as the balance had not inclined in favor of either nation another engagement took place in sixth year of the war in the course of which just the battle was growing warm day was suddenly turned into night this event
agathocles also though closely pursued by the enemy by the advantage of the night coming on beyond all hope got safe off from them
instead of saying et nox he should have said et simul nox and immediately it was night newcomb questions the totality of this eclipse but assigns no clear reasons for his doubts
but having happened afterwards he could not but think it presaged ill to those against whom they marched besides eclipses of the luminaries always signify a change of affairs
in this chapter we shall for the most part be on firmer ground than hitherto because several of the most eminent greek and latin historians have left on record full and circumstantial accounts of eclipses which have come under their notice
pelopidas had come back from an embassy of which he had been to the king of persia they sent deputies to him to thebes to beg the favour of armed assistance with pelopidas as general the thebans willingly granted their request and an army was soon got ready
it is commonly known as the eclipse of agathocles and it is recorded by two historians of antiquity in the words following diodorus siculus says
and his astronomical labours were said to have included a prediction of this eclipse which moreover has the further interest to us that it has assisted chronologists and historians in fixing the precise date of an important event in ancient history
herodotus describing a war which had been going on for some years between the lydians and the medes gives the following account of the circumstances which led to its premature termination
though not total at sardis yet the eclipse was very large ninety-four per cent of the sun being covered if we accept this it follows that the usually recognised date for the battle of salamis must be altered by two years
the question was finally settled by the late sir g b airy after an exhaustive inquiry in favour of the eclipse of five hundred eighty five b c this date has the further advantage of harmonising certain statements made by cicero and pliny
it is not at the first easy to localise the position of the fleet except that we may infer that it could hardly be yet more than eighteen or at the most a hundred miles away from the harbour of syracuse where it had been closely blockaded by a carthaginian fleet
for agathocles and his fleet to have been in it yet we know for certainty that he was in it and in that year and no other year conversely if six hundred and three b c were accepted for the thales's eclipse
and may be quite conspicuous in annular or a considerable partial eclipse the exaggeration of the single object to a plural is in generally very easy another difficulty is to be sure of the locality where the eclipse was total
xenophon then proceeds to say that when the persians obtained the empire from the medes the king of the persians besieged the city but was unable by any means to take it till a cloud having covered the sun and caused it to disappear completely
sir g b airy was such a very careful worker and investigator of eclipses that his conclusions in this matter have met with general acceptance
he says the prediction of this eclipse by thales may fairly be classed with the prediction of a good olive crop or the fall of an arolite thales indeed could only have obtained the requisite knowledge for predicting eclipses from the chaldeans
would so raise the position of the shadow and as to throw it far too much to the n of sicily for agathocles who we know must have gone southwards to africa to have entered it
day was thus turned into night we are told that as king was going against greece and had come into the region of  hellespont there happened an eclipse of the sun in the east this sign portered to him his defeat
with the annular eclipse that happened seven years previously when caesar passed the the rubicon to which eclipse allusion has already been made
we have now to consider another ancient eclipse which has a history of peculiar interest as regards the investigations to which it has been subjected
if this is correct plutarch's language must be incorrect or at least greatly exaggerated for no more than about three fourths of the sun was obscured on february twenty-nine three hundred fifty-seven b c
on a date which corresponds to february eleven two hundred eighteen or two hundred seventeen b c an eclipse of the sun which was partial in italy is mentioned by livy
geographical miles seem to intervene between the most southerly position which could be assigned to the fleet of agathocles and the most northly possible limit of the path of the eclipse shadow
and that the eclipse must have been that of march seven fifty-one b c the circumstances of this eclipse have been investigated by hind who found that the eclipse was an annular one the angular face less than six and a half minutes in the northern italy
the more so that very high authorities in the domains of astronomy and chronology and antiquities take opposite sides in the matter
it must however in fairness be stated that a very competent american astronomer professor newcomb has expressed doubts as to whether after all
he does this by refusing to see in the above quotations from herodotus any allusion to a solar eclipse at all but invites us to consider a later statement in herodotus as relating to an eclipse though the historian only calls it a prodigy
the tables used by baily were distinctly inferior to those now in use and sir g b airy thought himself justified in saying that to obviate the discordance of one hundred and eighty miles just referred to
it is said by frequent intoxication recorded an interesting event in the following words nonis junii soli luna obstetit et nox on the nones of june the moon was in opposite to the sun and night
if he had predicted it to the lydians in whose country the eclipse was to be total his conduct would be intelligible but it seems strange that he should have predicted it to the ionians who had no direct interest in this event
and herodotus states that while he was offering sacrifice to know if he should march out against the persian the sun was suddenly darkened in midsky
there happened an eclipse also visible in or near the mediterrean this is supposed to have been the eclipse for the prediction of which helicon a friend of plato received from dionysius king of syracuse payment for the shape of a talent
i have in the many preceding pages been citing ancient eclipses for the reason more or less plainly expressed that they are of value to astronomers as assisting to define the theory of the moon's motions in its orbit and this they should do
then to rise northwards the position of the shadow in that year from the line of the red sea and the persian gulf that it might pass through asia minor
but this is difficult to accept especially as plutarch in his life of pelopidas says an army was soon got ready but as the general was on the point of marching the sun began to be eclipsed and the city was covered with darkness in the daytime
the king was at no less pain to satisfy them about this affair than about the war and therefore he told them that he should have thought this sign an ill presage for them if it had happened before they set out
thucydides states that during the peloponnesian war things formerly repeated on hearsay but very rarely confirmed by facts became not incredible both about earthquakes and eclipses of the sun which came to pass more frequently than had been remembered in former times
the sudden darkness was looked upon as an unfavourable omen and threw the sailors into the greatest consternation pericles observing that the pilot was much astonished and perplexed
notwithstanding my want of confidence i conceive the possibility of a real eclipse to be greater than in the eclipse of thales while we have the great advantages that the point of occurrence is well defined the shadow narrow
another dissentient is sir h c rawlinson who remembering that thales is said to have predicted a good olive crop and anaxagoras the fall of an arolite
this occurrence so frightened the cleombrotus that he drew off his forces and returned home it is uncertain from the narrative of herodotus whether cleombrotus returned to sparta in the autumn of the
it is commonly assumed that the description necessarily refers to something seen where the writer flourished or where he locates his story it seems to me that this cannot be safely done unless the statement is made in connection with some battle or military movement
had been foretold for the ionians by thales of miletus who predicted for it the very year in which it actually took place when the lydians and medes observed the change they ceased fighting and were alike anxious to conclude peace
upon his answering in the negative he said where is the difference then between this and the other except that something bigger than my cloak causes the eclipse
that there was for a long while a great deficiency of sunshine in italy about the time of caesar's death seems clear from remarks made by pliny plutarch and tibullus and the words of suetonius seems to imply something of meteorological character
and the identification of the eclipse is still uncertain hind's theory is that the allusion is to an eclipse and in particular to the eclipse of february seventeenth four hundred seventy-eight b c
but too much romance attache to the history of romulus for anyone to write with assurance respecting the circumstances of his career much of it is generally considered to be fabulous
passed within a hundred miles of syracuse a fact which is stated almost in those very words by the two historians who have recorded the doings of agathocles and his fleet in those years
this is where the matter was left by airy in eighteen fifty-three four years later the new solar and lunar tables of the german astronomer hansen were published and having been applied to the eclipse of five hundred eighty-five b c
plutarch in his life of pericles says the whole fleet was in readiness and pericles on board his own galley when there happened an eclipse of the sun
according to xenophon they found at this place a large deserted city formerly inhabited by the medes its wall was twenty-five feet thick and hundred feet high
in cicero's time the nones of june fell on the fifth but in the time of ennius who lived a century and a half before cicero the nones of june fell between june five and july four on account of the lunar years and the intercalary month of the roman calendar
and investigations by oppolzer and millosevich make it probable that the reference is to the total eclipse of the sun which happened on april sixth six hundred and forty-eight b c
the exact date of this eclipse was long a matter of discussion and eclipses which occurred in six hundred and ten b c and five hundred and ninety-three b c were each thought at one time or another to have been the one referred to
took his cloak and having covered his eyes with it asked him if he found anything terrible in that or considered it as a bad
it is an interesting question to inquire whether any allusions to eclipses are to be found in homer and no very certain answer can be given in the iliad book seventeen lines three hundred sixty-six two hundred sixty-eight the following passage will be found
lynn who pronounces but with some hesitation in favour of the eclipse of october two four hundred eighty b c as the one associate with the battle of salamis
and that the science of these astronomers although sufficient for the investigation of lunar eclipses did not enable them to calculate solar eclipses
the shadow of the eclipse of five hundred eighty five b c will be found to have passed where ancient history tells us it did pass namely through ionia and therefore through the centre of asia minor
on august fourteenth three hundred ninety four b c there was a large eclipse of the sun visible in the mediterranean it occurred in the forenoon and is mentioned by xenophon in connection with a naval engagement in which the persians were defeated by conon
newcomb found that the central line passed a long way from italy to wit far down in africa an eclipse of the sun is mentioned by dion cassius as having happened when csar crossed the rubicon
the date of this eclipse is distinctly known to be june twenty one four hundred b c but the hour was long in dispute professor zech found that the sun set at rome eclipsed
as to its having happened in the fourth year of the forty eight olympia another word or two may be interesting as regards to the share which thales is supposed to have had in predicting this eclipse
this was total at about ten a m at thasos and in the northern part of the aegean sea the acceptance of this date displaces by about half a century the date commonly assigned for the poet's career
whatever it was it was noticed clearly it could not have been an annular eclipse because no such eclipse then happened johnson suggests that arago confused the record of some meteorological interference with the sun's light
and that the maximum phase took place after sun-set hansen however with his better tables found that the eclipse was total at rome and that the totality ended at seven thirty-three p m
bosanquet replies to this by pointing out that miletus in ionia was the birthplace of thales and also that a shadow covering two degrees of latitude passing through ionia would also necessarily cover lydia
and as the final result it may be stated that all the foregoing dates are now known to an absolute certainty especially confirmed as they were in all essential points by a computer of the eminence of the late mr g r hind
by the harangue the hearts of the soldiers were somehow elevated but an eclipse of the sun that had happened during their voyage still possessed them with superstitious fears of a bad omen
this seems explicit enough assuming the record to be true and that the same incident is referred to by plutarch as by herodotus and aristides since the time when airy and hind examined this question all the known facts have been again reviewed by mister w t

it is hardly possible to guess the biographers of surtees maintain that he wanted to try his skill on scott then only known to him by correspondence and that having succeeded he was afraid to risk scott's friendship by a confession
no literary forgeries were ever much better done than the sham ballads which surtees of mainsforth imposed on sir walter scott the poems were spirited and good of their kind

whereby mrs harris she have often said to me what do them blessed infants occupy their little minds with afore they are called into that condition where unless changed at nuss providence have appointed them
she hath lit with it my study fire and it is fortunate indeed that i had made the copy of the ballad for you but the volume of the coquillart is alive to testify to the authenticity of the poem which after all is needless evidence as not even ritson could suspect of either the skill or the malice of such a forgery
but as it have been a cause of sorrow and strife let it be nameless between you and me for to have the name snuffey brought forward it is what the heart can forgive but never forget in this valley of the shaddock
my dear sir alas your warning comes too late an accursed example of a womankind fit descendant of that unhappy betty barnes
and though we wonder now that some of them could take in an expert it is by no means assured that we are even today acquainted with the whole of surtees' frauds why a man otherwise honourable kindly charitable and learned exercised his ingenuity so cruelly upon a trusting correspondent and a staunch friend

and though fragmentary it is the more precious as the style proves to demonstration and against the frantic scepticism even of a ritson the antique and venerable character of those compositions
and wonder at it i do not them chuzzlewidges and chuffeys being that distracting and ever proving to be some other person in disguise as would confuge a calculating boy

that wily person immediately sent scott a ballad on the feud between the ridleys and featherstones in which scott believed to the day of his death he introduced it in marmion the whiles a northern harper rude chaunted a rhyme of deadly feud how the fierce thirlwalls and ridleys all
but the little dog was brave and did not go away and soon timothy decided to vent his displeasure upon the whole family by leaving the house altogether
that night faint with hunger timothy climbed a tall sycamore tree and tucking his paws beneath him he tried to sleep but he kept longing for the cozy peaceful hearth which he had left as chilly winds swept through the woods and moaned through the sycamore
with three scrawny young birds so he had just put forth a paw to select one for his breakfast when down upon his back lighted the mother hawk and drove timothy off into the forest
most of the night he spent miserably trying to free himself from the sharp hedgehog needles the next morning he was hungry in a certain tree he found a bird's nest
upon his return he soon saw the little spotted dog occupying his place and eating from his own tin plate fiercely indignant at the sight
the little spotted dog stood up and welcomed him wagging his tail so hard that his whole body shook and he actually greeted poor timothy with a bark of joy
the first night in the forest he crouched beneath a clump of spruces soon a hedgehog came grunting along and when timothy spat at the hedgehog it simply turned its back upon him my you're a sad coward i'll teach you a lesson
poor miserable timothy the snow lay white upon the ground and timothy took long flying leaps to escape it occasionally he would pause to lift and flirt his feet for he hated to get them wet besides they ached with the cold
so with bright bead-like eyes trembling nose and whiskers the mouse taking courage just stared at timothy monarch of the kitchen
now the woods where timothy wandered alone were wild and lonely and in them were fierce bob cats ugly lynx with sharp tufted ears who snarled and fought at night and many others whom timothy had never met
after his lunch selfish timothy took a stroll ah if he only had suspected everything would soon be changed for him in the kitchen
still he did not offer to fight or give back to timothy his place on the hearth and actually ate up everything on the tin plate while timothy had to stand and look on with deep angry growls of jealous rage
after his nap timothy lazily stretched first one gray velvet foot then another strolled indolently to his plate turning over the food carefully selecting choice bits nosing out that which he scorned upon the clean hearth
for even now the dearest little stray dog with soft coat of white and tan spots had been received into the family while timothy was out
soon something soft and white came fluttering down from the sky and little flakes of cold snow began to settle upon timothy's gray coat while the wind began to howl and the storm to break where could he go
whereupon timothy to show that he bore no further ill will sidled and rubbed himself gently against the tan and white spotted coat of the gentle little dog
timothy arched his gray back until the fur stood up in ridges as he spat vindictively at the stranger while his big yellow eyes glared with such sullen hate that the little spotted dog shook with fear
for days timothy stayed there he managed to catch a few stray mice after a long chase but soon his sides grew thin his soft gray fur shabby and coarse and dark while his eyes were furtive and sullen
making its brown withered leaves flap and clatter in a lonely fashion quite different to the customary cheery singing of the copper kettle upon the hearth a family of hoot owls awoke in their nest in the sycamore
for timothy was a spoiled cat and he allowed no one to interfere everybody waited upon him moving their chairs even for he was monarch of the hearth
a thought struck him he would go back to the house and see if the spotted dog was still there so he crept to the kitchen window and peered in and by the light of the fire he saw that his place was still occupied by the little dog
said timothy then he began to cuff at the hedgehog and worry him the next thing timothy did was to climb a tree as fast as he could for the hedgehog had turned upon him and driven his nose full of sharp spines
but timothy's proud jealous spirit was nearly broken and one night he decided to go back to the hearth so he stole into the kitchen after everybody was asleep and then a wonderful thing happened
timothy saw the gray mouse quite plainly but he never felt hungry enough to bother much about chasing mice and just to show his supremacy timothy merely opened one eye and stared insolently at the mouse
so timothy went away vainly they searched for him even setting out his tin plate each day filled with chicken bones to tempt him back
as he washed and scrubbed his neglected fur coat making a complete and fresh toilet suitable for the kitchen the next morning when the farmer's wife came into the kitchen such a sight met her eyes
of course they would be so anxious to get him back that they would surely send the spotted dog away and then he timothy would return to the hearth
such a majestic air had timothy as he sat there in his own place which none presumed to usurp his silvery gray paws tucked neatly beneath his warm furry breast his big yellow eyes just mere slits of sleepiness
intending to snatch a morsel of food from timothy's plate which always stood there heaped with dainties but the next instant the little mouse had changed its mind for there sat timothy himself right upon the hearth in front of the fire guarding his plate
soon they discovered poor timothy and began to peck at him viciously hooting at him and glaring at him with great fierce eyes so that timothy hastily scratched his way down from the tree
then timothy and his friend ate together from the tin plate sat down upon the hearth and timothy began a whirring buzzing song of contentment which might even be heard above the singing of the copper kettle
then lonely timothy pining for sympathy ventured a trifle closer to the hearth and the little dog sidled over to meet him and actually began to lap timothy's rough fur tenderly
but timothy resolved to punish them all and the pampered fellow had actually taken to the woods for his heart was so filled with bitter hate and jealousy that he simply would not return to the kitchen
so off again crept miserable timothy to the great cold lonely barn he slept upon the hay where the cold snow sifted down upon him and the wind whined and howled over his head all night
uttering little muffled rumbling growls deep down inside which so terrified the foolish little mouse that he immediately scuttled off behind the wainscoting squeaking as he ran
mr waddington was taken aback but i picked all the beans he replied there were only the leaves left never mind that burton cried it is the leaves we want the tree where is it quick i want myself to feel absolutely safe
and let me tell you this that superstition you have spoken of has truth in it these beans are indeed a spiritual food they alter character they have the most amazing effect upon a man's moral system
three months will soon pass burton replied until that time is up i could not part with them but you can't imagine the professor pleaded how marvelously marvelously interesting this is to me
his face displayed the most utmost enthusiasm in his task it is most amazing this he declared drawing up a chair to the table
my dear young man he exclaimed my dear mr mr burton why this is wonderful where did you get these sheets do you say are you honestly telling me that they were written within the last thousand years
for five hundred years since the day of a russian scientist who lived on the black sea but whose name for the moment i have forgotten the whole subject has lain dead
for generations their dream has been looked upon as a thing as elusive as the philosopher's stone the transmutation of metals any of these unsolved problems
that let me tell you was three thousand years ago my young friend you have indeed been favored let me understand this thing burton said anxiously
mr cowper looked at his visitor in amazement my young friend he said are you going to tell me that you have seen one of these beans not only that but i have eaten one burton said in fact i have eaten two
without a doubt mr burton replied they were written in london a few months ago mr cowper was already busy surrounding himself with strange-looking volumes
strange he remarked very strange i haven't smelt that perfume since i was with the excavators at chaldea a real oriental flavor young man about your manuscript
the professor walked his guest to the front door he seemed reluctant to let him go take care of yourself mr burton he said yours is a precious life on no account subject yourself to any risks be careful of crossings don't expose yourself to inclement weather
i gave it to a child in the street on my way home from idlemay house he declared there was no sign of any more beans coming and i had more than enough to carry
there were gray clouds in the sky a north wind booming across the moors burton even shivered as he walked down the hill to the house where she lived
when burton had finished he rose to his feet in a state of great excitement this is indeed wonderful he declared it is more wonderful even than you can know of
there is very little of it burton said just a page or so which apparently the writer never had time to finish the sheets came into my hands in a rather curious way and i should very much like to have an exact translation of them
hum well well he continued starting upon his task with avidity we will talk about him presently this is indeed miraculous i am deeply grateful to you for having brought me this manuscript
presently he leaned back in his chair he kept one hand upon the loose sheets of the manuscript while with the other he removed his spectacles and closed his eyes for a moment
after a moment's hesitation he opened the gate passed up the neat little path and rang the bell it was opened after the briefest of delays by the trim parlor-maid is your mistress at home he asked miss edith has gone to london for two days sir
why should it have been deemed necromancy to endeavor to combine these parts to evolve by careful elimination and change to the perfect food
for the first time he realized the direction in which his thoughts had been traveling since he had left his rooms an hour ago he had to remind himself that it was the professor whom he had gone to see
these sheet are written in a language which has been dead as a medium of actual intercourse over two thousand years you meet with it sometimes in old egyptian manuscripts
your story that how it came into your hands is the most amazing romance i have ever heard it confirms many of my theories it is wonderful do you realize what has happened you in your insignificant person the professor continued shaking his finger at his visitor
at the first glance however his expression changed it was obvious that he was greatly interested it was obvious also that he was correspondingly surprised
burton told his story with absolute sincerity the professor was intensely interested it was perhaps strange that extraordinary though it was he never for one minute doubted the truth of what he heard
nothing save objects and thoughts of beauty could present themselves to the understanding of the fortunate person who partook of it these pages which you have brought to me to translate are concerned with this superstition
there was a monastery somewhere near the excavations which i had the honor to conduct in syria where an ancient prayer book contained prayers in this language
it was to come to man in the nature of a fruit it was to give him not eternal life for that was valueless but eternal and absolute understanding so that nothing in life could be harmful
mr cowper received him graciously if a little vaguely burton wasted no time however in announcing the nature of his errand directly he produced the sheets the professor became interested
in the house young man which you have told me of there died the hero of the greatest discovery which has ever been made since the world began to spin upon its orbit
mr burton if the pages were written so recently where is the writer he is dead burton replied mr cowper sighed
young man mr cowper insisted i must eat one burton shook his head mr cowper he said there are reasons why i find it very hard to deny you anything but as regards those beans you will neither eat one nor even hold it in your hand
she shook hands and hurried away in less than an hour and a half he was in mr waddington's room the latter had just arrived from office mr waddington burton exclaimed the little tree on which the beans grew where is it
there are several points in connection with what you say which bear out a favorite theory of mine i will come in a few days if i may mister burton assured him
the faint odor which seemed shaken out of them into the room stimulated his curiosity he sniffed at it with great content
a green leaf of the little tree is to follow the consumption of the bean burton sprang to his feet a thousand thanks professor he cried that is the one thing we were seeking to discover the leaves of course
not as our more modern scientists of a few hundred years ago have done in the attempt to turn baser metals into gold but in the attempt to constitute from simple elements the perfect food for man
let me just have it to look at to be sure that what you have told me is not an hallucination burton shook his head i dare not part with one i am going back straight back to test the leaf theory if it is correct i shall keep my promise and will you remember me to miss edith when she returns
appears to have been produced in the shape of small beans they are to be eaten with great care and to ensure permanency in the results
sit down and i shall you a story which sounds which it might have happened a thousand years ago it happened in the last three months listen
burton shook his head he was somewhat mystified i have never heard anything of the sort he acknowledged the whole literature of ancient egypt and the neighboring countries mr cowper proceeded abounds with mystical stories of this perfect food
mr cowper was greatly excited where are they show me one where is the tree how did the man come to write this where did he write it let me see one of the beans burton produced the little silver snuff box in which he carried them with his left hand he kept the professor away
will miss edith be back tomorrow burton asked the professor stared at him miss edith he replied oh my daughter is she not in
mr cowper was busy for the next quarter of an hour his expression as he turned up dictionaries and made notes was still full of the liveliest and most intense interest
have tasted the result of thousands of years of unceasing study wise men in their cells before athens was built before pyramids were conceived were thinking out this matter in strange parts of egypt syria and asia
those pages say that if one eats a green leaf after the bean the change wrought in one will be absolutely permanent that is so the professor assented now all that you have to do is to eat a green leaf from the very tree
after that you will have no more need of these three beans and therefore you can give them to me burton made no attempt to produce his little silver box
keep away from any place likely to harbor infectious disease i should very much like to have a meeting in london of a few of my friends if i could ensure your presence when i come down again mr burton promised we will discuss this
i can do no more than that until this matter is absolutely settled they are worth more than life itself to me mr cowper seemed annoyed surely he protested you are not going to ask me to wait three months until i can examine one of these
did he mention anything about beans burton asked anxiously mr cowper nodded benignantly the perfect food referred to he said
leave them with me for a few days and i will make you an exact translation very well burton assented and one bean leave me one bean only  i promise not to eat it not to dissect it not to subject it to any experiments of the sort
the legend of the perfect food appears in the manuscripts of many centuries it antedates literature by generations there is a tomb in the interior of japan sacred to a saint who for seventy years worked for the production of this very bean
my young friend he said did you ever hear a quaint asiatic legend perhaps a superstition you could say that many and many a wise man for four thousand years spent his night and his days
the girl announced the professor is in his study sir burton stood quite still for a moment it was absurd that his heart should be so suddenly heavy that all the spring and buoyancy should have gone out of life
she is away for two days your servant told me burton replied perhaps so perhaps so the professor agreed she has gone to her aunt's very likely in chelsea my sister has a house there in bromsgrove terrace
no he cried you must not take these away you must not even think of it leave me the sheets just as they are i will go no further back there are several words at the meaning of which i have only guessed
to miss edith yes yes of course mr cowper declared impatiently when shall you be down again my young friend he went on earnestly i want to hear more of the experiences i want you to tell me the whole thing over again i should get a signed statement from you
it is indeed true that the fairy tales of one generation become the science of the next our own learned men have been blind the whole chain of reasoning is so clear every article of human food contains its separate particles affecting the moral as well as the physical systems
mr waddington's face was blank you have heard the translation of those sheets i have burton answered hastily i will tell you all about it directly as soon as you have brought me the tree mr waddington turned a little pale
remember that i have spent all my life digging among the archives and the literature and the superstitions of these pre egyptian people you are the first man in the world outside a little circle of fellow workers to come to speak of me of this food
burton rose to his feet he held out his hand for the manuscript i am extremely obliged to you my dear sir  now i must go
literally i cannot translate this for you actually i will i can get at the sense i can get at the sense quite well but if one could only find the man who wrote it he is the man i should like to see
i don't even know what the language is i thought perhaps you might be able to help me i will explain to you later if you allow me the exact nature of my interest in them mr cooper took the pages into his hand with a benevolent smile
but the sun which gave them life was hidden burton looked eagerly into the garden and his heart sank there was no sign there of any living person
first of all he said i must test the truth of this i cannot run any risks i must go and eat a leaf if in three months no change has taken place in me i will lend you a bean to examine
there was still gorse still heather still a few roses in the garden and a glimmering vision of the beds of the other flowers in the background
and sooner than soon i will return bringing you the magic treasure and the jewels and the crown and the scepter of this ohsma oh but you mustn't wailed jellia clasping her hands desperately
dorothy on the point of embracing jellia gave a little scream for the tell all escope which she had picked up just before leaving the plane was making terse announcements at this point it happened to be pointed at jellia clearing its throat it remarked in a superior way
but they had his arms pinioned behind his back and the poor tin woodman was unable to help himself oh that's all right answered strut i and the tin guy will ride in the friend ship
now hippenscop he directed shaking his finger at the odd-looking page you and junnenrump are to obey jellia in everything
they look like nothing you ever have imagined jellia told her with a slight shudder goochers here come some now oh it's those blowmen and all the others look wizard could we reach ozpril before they reach us
the poor lion was startled at jellia's question as the stratovanians from sheer shock he rose on his hind legs and gave a perfectly awful roar roar
fierce airlanders from the upper strat are descending in the emerald city of oz read the straw man nearly losing his balance if measures of defense are not taken at once the capital will fall under the fierce attack of the invaders
and down climbed the little wizard of oz followed by dorothy and the scarecrow the cowardly lion last of all had difficulty fitting his paws on the rungs and after a trembling descent rolled over on his back his four feet straight up into the air
we'll wait in the garden he whistled softly houses and castles are too stuffy and shut up for dear people if you need me princess just ring the silver bell
even at a distance jellia could spell out the name on the gleaming body and as the silvery plane came swooping toward them she could not repress a shout of joy
well it's certainly a mix-up said dorothy moving closer to the wizard what do these people look like jellia i'd really enjoy seeing a few
ozma is a real princess and much more beautiful than i in that case i shall bring ohsma and make her a starina also
it does sound like the master stuttered the blowman as the cowardly lion followed up his roar with a reverberating growl
what makes you think that strut has not returned questioned jellia grandly do you not recognize your master with a regal wave jellia pointed to the cowardly lion
lowering his head so the princess could slip the bell from his antlers the stag stood looking at us solemnly i will promised azarine azarine waved her little handkerchief and the two deer sprang away
and what are your majesty's wishes inquired jellia inclining her head graciously toward the trembling lion take that woman away and have our supper prepared and served at once in the royal pavilion directed the lion in his most commanding roar
this trip had not agreed with the cowardly lion at all weak and dizzy he made no attempt to rise
and of the curious celebrities who lived in the palace with ozma azarine was already charmed with scarecrow and the cowardly lion and kept leaning down to have a better look at the tawny beast trotting so unconcernedly between the two deer
i tell you she proposed generously i tell you if strut destroys the emerald city you can all come back and live with me that is if glinda and the wizard can make bustabo give my castle and kingdom back
here you are at last cried the wizard happily rushing over to jellia and seizing both of her hands so this is where you've been well i must say it's a nice place it's fine why it's beautiful beautiful
too exhausted by the dreadful ordeal that she had just been going through to run and meet the ship she jerked off her scarf and waved it wildly over her head
at a signal from strut one seized nick a second the soldier and a third was about to take hold of jellia when strut sternly waved him aside
swinging around so he could look in all directions the wizard positively glowed with interest and enthusiasm what's so beautiful about it growled the lion without turning over is there any grass are there any trees is there anything to eat
do you not that this is strut changed to the great beast by the ozma of oz but he is as powerful and as able as ever to rule this kingdom strut imperiously jellia appealed to the cowardly lion am i the starina of stratovania
about ten feet from the crystal boulder on which she had been sitting the ozpril came to a gentle and perfect landing scarcely had the whirr and the sputter of its engine died away before the door of the cabin burst open
oh please please couldn't you leave soldier to keep me company she sobbed wiping her streaming eyes on her sash of course of course if you wish
no not that one she is our new starina he told the blowman roughly now you are to stay here jellia my dear and help rule over stratovania while i descend to aus and take possession of that rich and prosperous country
which was perhaps as convincing an answer as he could have given there you see jellia shrugged her shoulders as queen kabebe and the blowmen turned as white as ghosts and began to move away

men of theoretical knowledge on the other hand are tempted to waste time in comparing and meditating when they should be up and doing practical knowledge will not always of itself
the great inventor is one who has walked forth upon the industrial world not from universities but from hovels not as clad in silks and decked with honors but as clad in fustian and grimed with soot and oil
it's a common saying that the man of practical ability far surpasses the theorist just what is meant by practical ability is perhaps hard to explain it is more easy to tell what it is not than what it is
stupendous works of nature and art which proclaim in no uncertain tones the triumph of perseverance all the performances of human art
irresolute men seek to lay their want of success at the door of the public well-matured and well-disciplined talent is always sure of a market provided it exerts itself but it must not cower at home and expect to be sought after there is a good deal of cant
thousands have spent the prime of life in the vain hope of help from those whom they called friends and many thousands have starved because they had a rich father rely upon the good name which is made by your own exertions

how many there are who thinking of the immense amount of work lying between them and the object of their desires are almost ready to give up in despair
hundreds of men go to their graves in obscurity who have remained obscure only because they lacked the pluck to make the first effort and who could they only have resolved to begin would have astonished the world by their achievements and successes
a man who sees limitedly and clearly is both more sure of himself and is more direct in dealing with circumstances and with men than is a man who has a large horizon of thought whose many-sided capacity embraces an immense extent of objects
he can endear himself to the community by kindly acts to the distressed as well as completely mastering in all its bearings the one great work which he has taken upon himself as his life's work
we are often compelled to a choice of acquisitions for there are some things the position of rich is incompatible with the position of others and the sooner this truth is known and recognized the better the chances of success and happiness
is to ask for impossibilities if you start for success you must expect to pay its price it cannot be won by feeble halfway efforts neither is it to be acquired because sought for in a dozen different directions
and never to give up the hope that better days may come it is wonderful to see what miracles a resolute and unyielding will
augmenting its weight or altering its organization it is visible only by its effects and perceptible only by its operations unlike those of the warriors the triumphs of intellect derive all their luster
at which we look with praise or wonder are instances of the resistless force of perseverance it is by this this the quarry becomes a pyramid
it is he who resolves to succeed and at every fresh rebuff begins resolutely again that reaches the goal the shores of fortune are covered with the stranded wrecks of men of brilliant abilities
that one must have to render his intercourse with society pleasing to himself or agreeable to others let boys and girls be taught first what is necessary to prepare them for the common duties of life
but do they not when they view the work thus in mass forget that there is time enough if only rightly improved to suffice for each effort one step after another
then take up your task remember that you must marshall all your forces at one point and move in one direction if you would accomplish what your desires have painted

reason may continue to widen its powers and deepen its sanctities there the affections may grow in beauty and fervor through innumerable ages mind may expand and intensify through eternity
not from the evil they have produced but from the good her successes and her conquests are the common property of the world and succeeding ages will be the watchful guardians of the rich legacies she
can achieve before its irresistible energy the most formidable obstacles become as cobweb barriers in the path difficulties the terrors of which cause the irresolute to sink back with dismay
so does he whose attention is diffused through innumerable channels so that it can not gather in force on any one point the human mind in short resembles a burning glass whose rays are intense only as they are concentrated
education is a work of progress it begins in life but has no end death does not terminate it we learn the elements of things below above we will study their essence we progress only by efforts

as the glass burns only when its rays are converged to a focal point so the former illumes the world of science literature or business only when it is directed to a solitary object
and decision of character we admire a person who knows his own mind and sticks to it who sees at once what is to be done in given circumstances and does it
be it ever so little and you may speak of it with confidence a few well defined facts and ideas are worth a whole library of uncertain knowledge we are frequently placed in position where we can learn with scarcely an effort on our part
then all that can be gained from fields of classic lore or works of polite erudition is of the utmost value in this enlightened age ignorance is a voluntary misfortune
much material good must be resigned if we would attain the highest degree of moral excellence and many spiritual joys must be foregone if we resolve at all risks to win great material advantages
and none the less reprehensible on that account than is the conduct of those who become so engrossed with the practical affairs of their calling or profession as to forget that they have a higher nature and sink the man in the pursuit of their ambitious dreams
for all who will drink deeply at the fountain of knowledge by the proper improvement of time the mechanic's apprentice may lay in a store of information that will enable him
it is but a truism to say that there can be no success in life without decision of character even brains are secondary in importance to will
but who have wanted courage faith and decision and have therefore perished in sight of more resolute but less capable adventurers who succeeded in making port

too about the successes of forward and impudent men while men of retiring worth are overlooked but it usually happens that those forward men have that valuable quality of promptness and activity without which
in the prosecution of duties or tasks but with all that has been urged in favor of decision and dispatch we would not be understood as advising undue haste
occasions also arise when we must rouse our forces on an instant's warning and to make movements for which we have no time to calculate the chances then is seen the triumph of the decisive ready man
the most successful the men who have wielded power have not always been graduates brindley and stephenson did not learn to read and write until they were twenty years old yet the one gave england her railroads and the other her canals
the multitude have looked upon them with wonder with reverent hands the world at large has crowned intellect with its richest honors
designs projected that are never begun and all for the want of a little courageous decision better far the silent tongue but the eloquent deed and the most decisive answer of all is doing there is nothing more to be admired than a manly firmness
the lofty mountains are wearing down by slow degrees the ocean is gradually but surely filling up by deposits from its thousand rivers and by the labors of a little insect so small as to be almost invisible to the naked eye
if the victory is ours success and fortune wait upon us if we are overthrown want and misery stare us in the face it is well to make our movements only with caution but when we see a chance we must at once improve it or it is gone

the intellect is but the half of a man the will is the driving wheel the spring of motor power a vacillating man no matter what his abilities is invariably pushed aside in the race of life by one of determined will

contented mind to indulge in sensual gratifications and yet demand health strength and vigor to live for self and yet to look for the joys that spring from a virtuous and self denying life
right we don't want to hit her well we can keep at one gravity for at least twelve hours then his father said and mrs carver breathed a sigh of relief she was still a bit worried about their undergoing such untried experiments even though she trusted the abilities of her menfolks
neither of us knows enough to handle it ourselves when it comes down to the actual work the boy's face fell then he forced a smile i hate to give in to anyone else on this but you're right as rain pop it is too big a fish for us to handle alone
it's not my credit dr svendholm's the one who but it was you who made up the fluid and induced you to take it his mother came over and ran her hand gently through his hair i'm proud of you
two fine boys then for jon is certainly every bit as deserving of your praise as i am sir that i'll certainly buy
if the board accepts our claim and data against his won't that be proof against him it should be you can bet your tackle i'll work on that angle space will be cleaner if that hellhound isn't in it you bet pop i hope you sink your hook in him this time
he tipped the needle into the light carefully expelled a couple of drops to make sure all air was out of the tube then quickly and with a sureness he had trouble making his hand achieve
and he blew her a kiss as the boys helped him into his pack and saw to it that he was securely and comfortably strapped in then they did the same for their mother
at his question they all looked up astonished and he continued there's the small matter of getting the colonial board's approval of our claim against the counterclaim we feel so sure bogin is coming in to make
jon's tone was dispirited and the dangers you were up against mrs carver's eyes were tear-dimmed their father caught himself then looked at each with a disarming grin
her hands clenched tightly well make as sure as we possibly can before we decide to do anything honey but don't you see the advantage of this if it will work we must get to terra first if we can and this seems to be the only way we know of doing it
as soon as he could he went into the galley quickly he prepared a cup of instant broth and drank it gratefully much refreshed he made more of the consomme and further enriched it with some anti fatigue pills dissolved in the steaming liquid
we've had brushes before when i was in other ships he's a skunk and ought to be behind bars but so far no one has been able to produce any real evidence of what all spacemen know must be true
carefully he administered the dosage of nutrients to the other three then lay down on his recline seat and gave himself his own dose he rested there for a couple of minutes then rose
i thought we were going to forget that nonsense his mother said sharply wait now marci let's hear what the boy has her husband said gently then go ahead jak
knowing neither discomfort nor the long passage of time while their little ship bored through the immensities of space at a constant negative acceleration of five gravities as before when they awakened they felt as though they had just gone to sleep
or bogin's rather his lips tightened in a few moments his tubes had warmed up but nothing came in over his ultra range receivers
and swung about with a stricken face what do you suppose is wrong pop the elder shook his head slowly only thing i can think of is that we're so far away the senders can't reach this far
he set four cups of it on a tray and carried them into the control room his first quick glance showed the other beginning to stir morning folks he called cheerily soup's on they opened their eyes slowly almost uncomprehendingly
but it'll take couple of hours maybe more to compute the last hop it's tricky especially i'll i'll have to look in the ephemeris to find the position of luna when we get near her orbit
he pushed the slim needle into her arm and injected the drug with the ball of his thumb he rubbed the puncture gently for a moment sleep tight mother he smiled and leaned down to kiss her who's next he turned to the others me of course his father bared his arm
then he stepped up to the pilot's pressure pack where his younger brother was adjusting the controls ready jon just a sec the boy was still working pushing in a button there turning a switch here
four c cs will act for about five days so i thought we could use that much the first time at least hmm five gs would certainly put us way ahead of bogin's ship jon had jumped up from the table and had been working swiftly with the computer
if bogin holds his acceleration plus and minus we can take most of the day and still beat him in jon had been doing some rapid preliminary figuring
jon tried to rise but reeled back and almost fell as he got onto his feet he held himself erect a moment and gradually felt a measure of strength returning
jon had filled four thermos bottles with strength regaining soup his mother had made and these were placed at each pressure pack ready for their awakening again the four lapsed into the complete unconsciousness of suspended animation
tell us more about this this medicine injected into our bloodstream puts us into suspended animation for several days depending on how much of the fluid we use we first take an injection of glucose and other nutrients of course
oh positively k mr carver agreed a master computer couldn't have done any better and jack has certainly proved himself to be a grand doctor
i don't see how he could've caught up with us but we don't know what his ship can do the guy's tricky and dirty but he does have a brain and he has some darned good technies in his crew
hey we're all crossing bridges where maybe there isn't even a creek to be spanned he made his voice mockingly cheerful what's happened to the good old carver spirit you're right pop jon shook away his dismay and began to smile we're not licked yet
now that we're alone father did you really come through alright you look a bit more tired and worn than before we started this
now almost fully awake his eyes sought the various meters dials gauge and telltales on his panel everything seemed to be working properly he tuned in his receptor and applied greater and still greater power
it's almost healed and there isn't a sign of inflammation not even a bump where the break was i i sure hope i set it right so that it won't bother you later on his father patted his hand
present routine which is all we can stand as we are bogin can beat us in besides he will undoubtedly shoot down the star rover if he catches up with it-and you know what would happen to us yes when i checked today he was only about two hundred million behind
stopping to tighten a wire or connection somewhere else but in a few moments he had finished and then rested his right hand on the handle of the master switch ready to push it into contact
i've got to hand it to you owl you sure fixed us fine this time he certainly did mr carver spoke as forcefully as he could
you did a grand job i know son and i'm very grateful to you-as well as proud of having such a fine boy
i think we should try it it seems safe from all the evidence here i have faith enough in jack's ability to trust him to have made the fluid correctly
jon and his father worked tirelessly until they had computed precisely where they were and how soon and how much more deceleration they would have to use to finish their trip
and probably in other places around the universe you can bet that prospectors will be hunting and finding it once we announce our discovery if we and the scientists can figure out what it was before it started losing its half-life
don't worry about me his brother said gruffly i'll make out some way not good enough jon said positively let's figure this down to seconds
nor did the others notice that he began disappearing into the ship's storeroom each up period and had to be called repeatedly when the meal was ready or it was time to strap down again
the others he turned quickly to look at them they were all still lying in their packs somewhat pale but with a peaceful unstrained look on their faces
jak smiled a bit strainedly i don't like it but i know how you feel about this so i'll keep quiet how's your leg thanks son our getting back first is very important to me and i can rest and get well after we reach earth and get the board's confirmation on our claim
the stuff to make us unconscious so we can stand five g's of acceleration jack looked up in hurt surprise what what we were talking about the other
i woke up just a few minutes ahead of you and that's one of the first things i looked at then i found i was weak and dry so i went out and made this broth he passed the cups and as the others drank gratefully jon spoke again
but just as jak brought the needle close to his arm the younger boy pushed it away wait now jak how about you can you make it to your pack and get in and strap down and settle and then give yourself the shot before i throw the switch and the five g's take effect
it is mainly my not knowing that makes me afraid sometimes she gave him a lopsided smile i hate being the weak member of the party you're nothing of the kind he grinned as the boys murmured protest which meant the same thing you're the best fellow in the gang
carefully he drew four cubic centimeters of the new clear fluid into his needle then approached his mother ready he asked smiling but with tight lips she pushed up her left sleeve ready son and now her voice was soft but steady
jon has to be awake last to handle the controls again jak filled his needle and as carefully as before he injected the sleeping drug into his father
then they too relaxed for the balance of the day late that afternoon jon suddenly swiveled his chair about to face his father's reclined seat i think i've figured out something on that new fuel and how to use it pop ships'll have to be changed though
jak thought swiftly a moment your point's well taken jon but you didn't figure it right your way i'd have to give you your injection beside doing all the rest in the same length of time if i give you yours first i can get into my pack and give myself mine there
as he saw jak's nod that was all done he turned to his panel a quick glance about his board with his fast diminishing senses told him everything was on the green with his last measure of consciousness he rammed home the switch
for long anxious minutes he worked but still no sounds save the noise of cosmic rays and the other forces of the void that made long distance communication such a problem with a weary gesture jon finally turned off the set
this close to terra it could be some other ship not bogin's could be and probably is his father stroked his chin reflectively
he said nothing of what he was doing nor did any of the other think to ask for the boys were customarily here and there about the ship busy at their many tasks and activities
these boys of ours are really up on their stuff yes she agreed i know they know what they are doing and that you are checking them carefully
sure i'm ok mr carver said quickly but he could not meet his son's eyes you're not sir and you know it and i know it
bins and everything with force fields as an added precaution mm maybe they could at that we'd better put it up to the scientists and technies back on terra
i've got it he exclaimed his eyes shining i found all the ingredients needed in our stores and my medical kit and made up a batch of the cataleptic fluid we inject four c c's in each of us and what you're talking about jon demanded
won't that be in our favor jak asked if they can't hear any signals at all our records ought to be enough maybe yes maybe no mr carver answered with a tired smile and after all our hard work too
and then the change and that should have made them wonder why so our explanation ought to satisfy them that reminds me jon swung back to his panel let's see if we can pick up our signals from there
swiftly then he ran to his own pack climbed in and fastened the straps he filled the needle plunged it into his arm and pushed home the plunger jon had been watching his brother forcing back the drowsiness that sought to engulf him
jak went to his room and came back quickly with his hypodermic needles and the bottle of glucose and concentrates he put these beside the test tube with the new fluid
and that his skin felt dry too and feverish but he had no headache and his thoughts seemed to be functioning as clearly and swiftly as always boy i sure need a bath and drink and something to eat he thought then realized that the others would be feeling the same way
he settled back into a more comfortable position and felt himself plunging down the blackness of unconsciousness jon felt himself coming awake and his first startled thought was didn't the stuff work
what sort of shape would it leave us in his father almost raised up in interest and held up his hand when his wife would have broken in are there
i figure the people who used to handle the stuff made the nuggets that exact size on purpose that we'd not want to try making them the same size as our copper ones
the bins will have to be heavily lead-lined of course and so would the injector tubes have to be shielded the nozzle would have to be made smaller so the pellets will fit better
but i'm sure going to learn before i finish and some day when i run against anything like this again you can bet i'll know what to do what's the use of going all that trouble when you only have that small amount of fuel you found their mother asked curiously
and if we can learn how to use it he said firmly once metallurgists have had the chance to analyze it they won't take long to figure out exactly what it is and where it can probably be found the type of sun and planet that would have it i mean he added
space behind was blank of atomics smiling thankfully and beginning to unloosen his straps jon now noticed how dry his mouth was
and don't forget that we might not get back at all if bogin catches up with us he's ruthless about anyone who gets in his way as for the leg it aches some but not like it did before i really think it's healing in fine shape
let's have a look jak threw back the covers and peered closely at the leg lifting it so he could better see all around it yes he said finally as he tucked in the blankets again
you merely stay awake until i'm done yes guess you're right but fix your pack so you can be sure of getting in without any trouble jak did this then came back filled the needle and injected it into jon's arm
if i don't close the switch before i black out all this will be basted how about if you inject yourself first will you have time enough to give me my shot and then get back into your pack and strap down before you go under
mr carver reached out a hand and patted his wife's cheek as she stood by his side it's going to work out all right honey his voice was bright and assured
mr carver's eyes shone they all sat about during the day eating as much as they could hold of mrs carver's fine cooking and relaxing gratefully in the comfortable one gravity earth weight
and under the prime discoverer's code we'll get a percentage of the process won't we pop i think so that'll be up to the board but they usually pretty square about such things when it was time jak again gave the family the dosage of nutrients and then the shots
any after effects the book says the doctor never discovered any especially after he started giving people the nutrient injection first he has had people under for as much as two weeks
that sounds reasonable what about shielding for the generators there'd have to be a lot more of that too probably thick shields of neocarbolloy and paraffin but can't they surround the generators
then this stuff puts us into deep sleep slows our metabolism you said in such a state we could stand much heavier acceleration father then with this we can beat bogin
but while they were eating a short time later jon turned his seat to face his father don't like to start worrying again pop he said in a low voice but our receptor is picking up atomic activity behind us again of course he added quickly
having already privately warned jak to say nothing of his weakened condition he looked solicitously over at his wife you alright marci
we sure did jon smiled broadly we were out just a little over five days and the receptors don't show a thing behind
how much time after the injection before we blank out owl jon asked then a minute or so i guess why figuring how long i'll have to handle the controls a minute is plenty of time as i can have everything set up and only have one switch to throw
he'd know from his own receptors when we started speeding up so fast and he'd do something to counteract that if he could i've heard things like that about him but i don't know him i do grimly
but at the start of one up period jak went at once to the storeroom and workshop and when he came back to the table set in the control room he showed his family a large corked test tube filled with a colorless liquid
let's try it jak was all eagerness take it easy son we've got to talk and study this a lot first mr carver then turned to his wife who had sunk back into her seat biting her lips to keep from crying out
mr carver thought slowly and intently then spoke decisively i believe that this is our best bet if it's sure we certainly want to get back first if possible and according to our
he began to open his eyes and noticed at once how stiff his eyelids felt but he forced them open he looked at the date clock and smiled with relief the five days and several hours had passed seemingly in an instant
where were they how much of their utterly incomprehensible top speed did they have left practically perfect jon exclaimed happily after nearly an hour of careful computations as he read the last tapes from the calculator it works out at one point eight four g's to atmosphere
he sure is his younger brother paid deserved tribute jak reddened a bit and hastily left the control room to help his mother with her work they all took warm baths and changed their clothing as jak was helping his father he asked anxiously
ouch you would have to think of that jon grumbled but mr carver smiled up at his wife there's plenty on planet five remember

i said tom what is it all about i must know what kind of a suit it is before i can supply the latin appropriately
while all this was going on we were holding pow pows every day with the indians endeavoring to straighten out and clear up all the vexed questions between us
which i translated to mean i did not enter into this contract he was delighted and said there ought to be no doubt of success with the aid of this formidable weapon and made me promise to ride down with him to hear him get it off
gentlemen of the jury it is indelibly recorded in all the works of roman jurisprudence non haec in federe veni which means there can be no crime without criminal intent
he accordingly proposed that he should study with me which idea i strongly encouraged and after about six weeks of diligent reading
fortunately nothing of this kind was tried but i was convinced that no one can be too cautious when in the country of a savage enemy a good lesson can be learned from this narrative by the people now occupying the country of the filipinos
the justice's court was about a mile from the road in a carpenter shop the proprietor of which was the justice tom told him to demand a jury and he would stop on his way back and help him out
i tented with the major and seeing that the indians were allowed to come inside of the picket lines with their guns in their hands i took the liberty of saying to him that i did not consider such a policy safe because the indians could
made by the insured on the making of the policy and he must have some latin to illustrate and strengthen his point
things went on quietly until one day a young soldier went down to the spring with his bucket and dipper for water and an indian who desired to make a name for himself among the among his fellows
the officers of the battery were major sherman first lieutenant ayer and second lieutenant du barry its force of men was about sixty including noncommissioned officers i think it had four guns
and i having been elected to the supreme bench mr cowan decided to study law and open an office for the practice of that profession
the scheme of the savages was to spring to their feet on a concerted signal and begin firing their guns all around the council circle so as to create a great excitement and bring everyone to his feet
followed him stealthily and when he was in a stooping posture filling his bucket came up behind him and plunged a long knife into his neck
these men were each armed with the minie rifle which was first introduced into the army and which was quite an effective weapon
but of this i'm not certain one day after skirmishing about over considerable country we made a camp on the yellow medicine river near a fine spring and everything seemed comfortable
he took a leading part in politics was made register of deeds of his county went to the legislature and was nominated for lieutenant governor of the state after its admission into the union
when the time arrived every indian in the ring jumped to his feet and fired in the air creating a tremendous fusilade and as had been expected the most frightful panic followed
the effect was electrical the jury acquitted the prisoner and we drove home fully convinced that the law was not an exact science
and he was given up by the indians i noticed one thing however no more indians were allowed inside the lines with their guns in their hands
his first venture was in the fur trade but not knowing anything about it his success was not brilliant i remember that he once paid an immense price for a very large black bearskin thinking he had struck a bonanza
all kinds of schemes to take it the principal one of which was to fill bladders with water and pour them over the touch holes of the guns and as they supposed render them useless and then open fire on the men
we hitched the team and i spread myself comfortably on a pile of shavings to witness the legal encounter and complaining party proved his case cowan put his client on the witness stand and showed the provocation
so the next day we started and in crossing the le sueur prairie cowan was hailed by a man who said he was under arrest for having kicked a man out of his house for insulting his family and he wanted tom to defend him
wiley remarked he bear not worth a damn which decision induced tom to abandon the fur trade there being no lawyer but one at traverse des sioux
his name will be at once recognized by all the old settlers he was a scotchman and had been in business in baltimore financial difficulties had driven him to the west to begin life anew and grow up with the country
when the prisoner was brought into camp a guard tent was established and he was confined in it with ten men to stand guard over him
so i said no more but it was just such misplaced confidence that afterwards cost general canby his life among the modocs when he was shot down by captain jack
principally devoted to the statutes i admitted him to the bar and he fearlessly announced himself as an attorney and counselor at law
contrary to expectations every one of the ten guards opened fire on him and seven of them hit him but curiously not one of the wounds
the shock nearly prostrated the soldier but he succeeded in reaching camp the major immediately demanded the surrender of the guilty party
a flask from your pocket or holster you asked me to take a drink that is a long time ago but i remember it as the best drink i ever had and i always associate you pleasantly with it
with what effect tom utilized his latin in the insurance suit i have forgotten or was never advised
and just at this moment the prisoner in the guardhouse was to make a run in the direction of the council keeping exactly between the guard and the whites in the council ring believing that the soldiers would not fire for the fear of killing their own people
every one of whom had a gun in his hands i had warned the major frequently not to allow an indian to come into council with a gun but he deemed it better not to show any timidity and they were not prohibited
the council on this occasion was held about four hundred yards from the battery camp and on lower ground but with no obstruction between them
intending of course to kill him but as luck would have it the knife struck his collarbone and doubled up so the indian could not withdraw it
those present consisted of all the traders superintendent cullen major sherman lieutenant ayer in fact all the white men at agency about one hundred indians
he was a very well read and companionable man and exceedingly bright by nature and at once became very popular with the people
when we arrived at le sueur we found that the case could not be heard that day and starting homeward about four o'clock we reached the carpenter shop there we found the jury awaiting us
the tall sergeant had matured into most dignified and charming gentleman with whom i have ever since enjoyed the most agreeable relations
the manner of holding a council was to select a place on the prairie plant an american flag in the center and all hands squat down in a circle around it
i said i recall the event quite clearly but not the sergeant he said one day after a long hot march i was laying out the camp and you were sitting on your horse observing the operation when you noticed me and called me to you and pulling
the moral of the story is that when you are in a country of hostile savages never accept any confidences or take any chances and when you have more drinks than you can conveniently absorb divide with your neighbor
indian strategy in the summer of eighteen fifty-six i had the celebrated battery commanded by major t w sherman of the united states army
then he addressed the jury his defense was want of criminal intent he dwelt eloquently on the point that the gist of the offense was the intent with which the act was committed
so one day they suggested a certain place for the holding of the council giving some plausible reason for the change of location and when the time arrived everybody assembled and the ring was formed
in this venture he was phenomenally successful he was a fine speaker made an excellent argument on facts and soon stood high in the profession
and when it appeared that the act was justified there could be no crime then casting a quizzical glance at me he struck a tragic attitude and thundered out
it very much resembles turkish diplomacy but the weather was pleasant and everybody was patient the indians however were concocting plans all this time to effect the escape of the prisoner in the guardhouse
the formation of the camp was a square with the guns and tents inside and a sort of a picket line on all sides about a hundred yards from the center on which the sentinels marched day and night
at his office in the capitol and after completing it i was about to retire when the general said to me judge you don't seem to remember me i replied general did i ever have the pleasure of your acquaintance
but of course in all his practice he was never quite certain about the law of his cases this deficiency was made up by dash and brilliancy and he got along swimmingly
the prisoner never was caught but i heard a great deal about him afterwards his exploit of stabbing the soldier and his almost miraculous escape made him one of the most celebrated medicine men of his band
one pleasing circumstance resulted from the presence of this battery in the indian country about thirty years after the occurrences i've been narrating i had occasion to transact some business with the adjutant general of our state
at a concerted signal each pick out his man and shoot him down and then where would the battery be but the major's answer was oh we must not show any timidity
stopped his progress and he got away but the bullets went over and among the whites one ricocheting through the coat of major cullen
is the biggest suit we have ever had in the valley and i think it ought to have some latin in it and i want you to furnish me with that ingredient
and everyone thinking that a general massacre of the whites had begun they scattered in all directions instantly the present prisoner ran for the crowd and an indian can sprint like a deer
he kept it on exhibition until one day john s prince who was an experienced fur buyer dropped in and after listening to cowan's eulogy on the on his bear skin
then the speechifying would commence and last for hours without any satisfactory results anyone who has had much experience in indian councils is aware of the hopelessness of arriving at a termination of the discussion
and especially as i am not very much up in latin myself he said the suit was on an insurance policy that he was defending on the ground of misinterpretations
not exactly he said but don't you remember the time when you had the old sherman battery in the field with its tall first sergeant
and he continued to work wonders thenceforth after the return of the battery i was informed by my close friends among the indians that they had sat on the hills overlooking the camp and concocted
better known as the buena vista battery from the good work it did in the mexican war on duty in the indian country on account of a great excitement which prevailed among the indians
three after dinner that night mr liggers unbosomed himself to mr dunham another master in the schoolhouse you have sometimes accused me said mr liggers of being a bit too rough with that chap langsdyke
he could not of course have given smithson away or duncan more especially as he had already punished duncan himself still he did not much like being spoken to in that way and it was only the fear that on some further investigation the real culprit
that is your lookout said the celestial you got a tongue in your head if you do not see what you want kindly ask for it in that way we shall rise on stepping-stones of our dead selves to higher things
two in due course of time langsdyke's home truths made a successful appeal to its limited public the method of production was original
if you produce a magazine and leave it about where we can find it you must take the consequences of that also strictly speaking said langsdyke it shouldn't have been left about we made a rule that it was to be kept in the lockers when it wasn't being read
the discussion of the magazine continued and various duties were assigned banks for instance was required to provide accurate information
as the josser remarked who did the stuff that the sixth had to cork into elegiacs this morning how did you know asked smithson because fathead i heard the stuff being given out to them and that don't explain how you remembered it said smithson who never remembered anything
that had eat one of these green things with the red stripe around them and tell me if they're any good the school magazine is rot it contains reports of concerts telling us how the swanlike voice of smithson was heard to great advantage
yes sir said the celestial well i don't expect much from you but i thought you were more of a man than that who wrote it the celestial hesitated well practically i did he said
well said the celestial i cannot stop to explain it to you because i'm just about to give my celebrated imitation of a lion-hearted english schoolboy cutting cricket on a beastly hot saturday afternoon and getting a surreptitious swim in the river rathe
i explained that i drew the line at emperors and in a fit of uncontrollable passion the bounder has given me the first chorus to learn by heart smithson eschylus forward show agamemnons
having in his hand the rough pencil notes of news given to him by his accomplished staff smithson knelt on the floor with a penny exercise book and his inkpot on a form beside him and took down the paragraphs that his editor dictated to him
there is no practically about it you did or you didn't then i did said the celestial then you will learn for me by heart the first chorus in the agamemnon
we do not expect you always to speak of us with the same respect with which you speak to us but if you speak disrespectfully of us and allow us to overhear you have to take the consequences
if it were any use i would ask you to try to behave more like a gentleman in the future but i do not think it is boys of the type that would do that kind of thing would be better out of the place altogether and that is how i expect you will end langsdyke
well well said mr liggers i can settle afterwards what we will do about your precious magazine what i wanted to speak about particularly was one paragraph in it dealing with the wife of one of the masters you let that paragraph go in
it was no reason for a sandy-haired pudding-faced pig of the prairies like duncan to call attention to it the chastisement was administered smiling and it left duncan with a strong desire to propitiate the celestial
as to all the head master's dinner parties including a list of the guests and exact transcript of the menu douglas was to furnish short biographies of any visitors at the schoolhouse that's all very funny said douglas but how am i to get em
now smithson was above all things a slow conscientious and painstaking boy he had been told by the celestial his lord and master to black out the offending paragraph and he had only got a g pen to do it with
i'll come too said smithson you will bet your last boots you won't as socrates very pointedly observes where one can slink out all right two may be missed
and has not yet been followed by the bulk of the leading london magazines the celestial lay at full length on his back on a table in the day room
now you can go and send up that number of your magazine to me at once langsdyke was extremely angry as he came down the stone stairs
to me to contain a good deal of impertinence it was not intended to be shown to the masters sir quite so said mr liggers quite so i see the justice of that plea
if you will kindly cease this unmannerly and intempestive laughter said the celestial with an excellent imitation of his head master's manner of speech i will give you a few thoughts that have occurred to me on this subject
the magazine consisted almost entirely of paragraphs the following are some of the more elegant extracts from the first number anyone who is reading this magazine is requested to keep it in his locker when he isn't
the spirit sisters whispered to kahala telling her the purpose attending the use of the ape leaves and asking her to break as many of them on either side of her as she could without attracting undue attention
down into the water and seized and crushed this spirit face between his mighty hands thus it was destroyed before it could return to its home of flesh and blood
another is a squat rough image crudely carved out of wood this was kamehameha's poison god the ancient hawaiians were acquainted with poisons of various kinds they understood the medicinal qualities of plants and found some of these strange enough to cause sickness and even death
kauhi in despair recognized the girl whom he had several times tried to slay in bitter disappointment at the failure of his ghost test the chief sorcerer as the kalakaua version of this legend says declared that he saw and felt the presence of spirits in some manner connected with her
the ghosts would leap or fly or climb into the branches of the tree trying to find a rotten branch upon which they could sit until it broke and threw them into the dark sea below
when the priest wanted kalai pahoa he was taken down and anointed with coconut oil and wrapped in a fresh kapa cloth then he was set up above the altar and a feast prepared before him awa to drink and pig fish and poi to eat
kane ia kama made cloaks of the long leaves of the ieie vine and tied them around his men so that their bodies could not be touched then the work was easily accomplished the chief kept these images of gods cut from the medicinal trees and could use them as he desired
in his anxiety to detect and seize the spirits who might be attending kahala he forgot about himself and leaned over the calabash his own spirit face was the only one reflected on the surface of the water
then he threw the cup numbered twenty won all the property and gave it back to kulioe at last he found kewalu but she was by the side of the high chief milu
but he did not wish to take his sister-wife with him perhaps the omens of their childhood had revealed danger to kewalu if she left her home by the sea whenever he tried to steal away from her she would rush to him and cling to him persuading him to wait for new sports and joys
one of the priests would then take the awa cup drink the contents and quickly take food those who were watching would presently see a red flush creep over his cheeks
we have not paid him well for his care then they decided to go and give life to the father and permit him to take his ghost body and go down to po the dark land to bring back the ghost of the boy so they went to maluae and told him that they were sorry for what they had done
kahala the rainbow maiden was thus restored several times by the owl god but with this last failure it seemed to be certain that the body would grow cold and stiff before the spirit could return the spirit hastened to and fro in great distress trying to attract attention
which no other among either mortals or spirits should know beside themselves while kewalu was singing she introduced her part of this chant suddenly from among the throng of ghosts arose the sound of a clear voice chanting the response which was known by no other person but hiku
these spirits he claimed must be detected and punished a second form of ghost testing was proposed by akaaka the mountain god
and repair the injury ku told him that only by the most daring effort could he hope to regain his loved bride he could go to the under-world meet the ghosts and bring his sister back but this could only be done at very great risk to himself
the chief sorcerer fell dead by the side of the calabash by means of which he had hoped to destroy the friends of the rainbow maiden in this trial of ghosts the two most powerful methods of making a test as far as known among the ancient hawaiians were put in practice
were not surprised when she threw a mantle around herself and left them to go away alone into the shadows she wandered from place to place among the groups of ghosts looking for hiku
said the mother that is the clapping of hands of a large number of men and women the people who live by the sea are very much pleased and are expressing their great delight in some wonderful deed of a great chief
or perhaps hiku had endured many dangers of the lower world by coming even in human form to find her and therefore must remain concealed the people around the king seeing her grief
when kewalu came near she took the wreath of rare and fragrant flowers which she wore and coming close to him threw it around his shoulders as a token to all the people that she had taken him to be her husband
as he entered the under-world he again tasted the food of the gods and he felt himself growing stronger and stronger he took a magic war-club and a spear out of the cane given by the gods ghostly warriors tried to hinder his entrance into the different districts of the dark land
the story of kahala and her connection with the rainbows and waterfalls of manoa valley has been told from time to time in the homes of the nature-loving native residents of the valley
therefore he rubbed his body once more thoroughly with the oil and disfigured himself with dirt as he passed from place to place searching for kewalu the ghosts said what a bad-smelling spirit so they turned away from him as if he was one of the most unworthy ghosts dwelling in milu
hiku chanted are you known by papa and wakea o eyelashes or rays of the sun mine is the cup of kilu her cup did not touch the kilu post before hiku
the sunlight shone in splendor upon his polished body when he stood on the board and rode to the shore on the crests of the highest surf waves performing wonderful feats by his magic power
a ghost walking upon them could not make any impression untorn leaves would condemn mahana to the ovens to be baked alive and the spirit catchers would be called by the sorcerers to seize the escaped ghost and carry it back to spirit-land
halfway between manoa and waikiki both wanted the beautiful arch to rest over their homes and a maiden the descendant of the gods to dwell therein
near the seacoast of this estate was one of the most noted ghost localities of the islands the ghosts after wandering over the island oahu would come to this place to find a way into their real home the underworld or po
this spirit face was believed to be his own true spirit escaping for the moment from the body and bathing in the liquid before him akaaka leaped forward thrust his hands
here was a ghostly breadfruit tree named lei walo possibly meaning the eight wreaths or the eighth wreath the last wreath of leaves from the land of the living which would meet the eyes of the dying
in it are images of many of the gods of long ago one of these is a helmeted head made of wicker-work over which has been woven a thick covering of beautiful red feathers bordered with yellow feathers this was the mighty war-god kukailimoku of the great kamehameha
thus hiku married his sister kewalu according to the custom of that time because she was the only one of all the people equal to him in rank and beauty and he alone was fitted to stand in her presence for a long time they lived together sometimes sporting among the highest white crests of stormtossed surf waves
a native writer says that there was an antidote for the poison of kalai pahoa and he thus describes it the war god and the poison god were not left standing in the temples like the images of other gods after being worshipped were wrapped in kapa and laid away
he told her to wander around and yet to follow him 'til they came to the ieie vine which he had left hanging from the hole which opened to the upper world when hiku came to the place where the vine was hanging he took hold to see if ku his father was still carefully guarding the other end to pull him up when the right signal should be given
kewalu was overcome by the thought that perhaps hiku was dead and was now among the ghosts but did not dare to incur the hatred of king milu by making himself known
there was one chief who was very skilful in waving kahilis or feather fans over any one and shaking the powder of death into the food from the moving feathers
day after day the rejoicing of the people was heard by the young chief at last he sent a trusty retainer to learn the cause of the tumult the messenger reported that he had found certain tabu surf waters of the kona beach and had seen a very high chiefess
they began to cut the koko blood of the trees as the natives termed the flowing sap and the chips flying out struck some of the woodcutters and they fell dead
who had seen the beautiful princess as she came into the under world more glorious was kewalu than any other of all those of noble blood who had ever descended to milu the ghosts had welcomed the spirit of the princess with great rejoicing and the king had called her at once to the highest place in his court
hiku heard the chant and mingled with the multitude of ghosts gathered around the place where the high chiefs were welcoming the spirit of kewalu while hiku and kewalu had been living together one of their pleasures was composing and learning to intone a chant
near the heiau when the great noise made by the people aroused her she sent one of her friends to learn the cause of such rejoicing when she learned that an exceedingly handsome chief of the highest rank was sporting among her tabu waters she determined to see him
how could these ghosts be detected they would certainly appear in human form and be carefully safeguarded the chief sorcerer of kauhi's family told kauhi to make secretly a thorough test
many times as when rendered unconscious it was believed that the spirit had left the body but for some reason had been able to come back into it and enjoy life among friends once more
sometimes enjoying the guessing and gambling games in which the hawaiians of all times have been very expert sometimes chanting meles and genealogies and telling marvelous stories of sea and forest
this could be done by taking the large and delicate leaves of the ape plant and spreading them over the place where kahala must walk and sit before the judges a human being could not touch these leaves so carefully placed without tearing and bruising them
the overthrow of idolatry and destruction of the system of taboos came in eighteen nineteen but most of the wooden gods were burned or thrown into ponds and rivers but a few were concealed by their caretakers among these were the two gods now to be seen in the bishop museum in honolulu
at last the chief buried the body deep down under the roots of a large koa tree the owl god scratched and pulled but the roots of the tree were many and strong his claws were entangled again and again at last he concluded that life must be extinct and so deserted the place
but the gods of the sea favored hiku hiku had never been to the seaside and had never learned the arts of those who were skillful in the waters nevertheless as he entered the water he carried the surfboard more royally than any chief the people had ever known
the face in the water had been grasped by the watcher crushed between his hands and the spirit destroyed the chief sorcerer eagerly ordered a calabash of water to be quickly brought and placed before him
she had not been long with the chiefs of milu before they asked her to sing or chant her mele her mele was the family song by which any chief made known his rank and the family with which he was connected whenever he visited chiefs far away from his own home
she threw again but did not touch while hiku chanted the same words they took a new cup but failed hiku commenced swinging the cup and threw it glided and twisted around the floor and struck the post thus counted five and won the first bet
for if the ghosts discovered and captured him they would punish him with the severest torments and destroy all hope of returning to the upper-world hiku was determined to search the land of milu and find his bride and bring her back to his kona home by the sea
hiku said i have nothing i have only come this day and am alone kulioe bet his bones against some of the property he had lost the first girl threw up her cup at the kilu post
this was a method frequently employed throughout all the islands of the hawaiian group it was believed that any face reflected in a pool or calabash of water was a spirit face many times had ghosts been discovered in this way
the spirit of the murdered girl was wandering around hoping that it could be restored to the body and not be compelled to descend to milu the underworld of the hawaiians
another would have scrapings in his cloak and would drop them into whatever food his enemy was eating the spirit of death was supposed to reside in the wood of the poison god
maluae climbed up the breadfruit tree he found a branch where ghosts were sitting waiting for it to fall his weight was so much greater than theirs that the branch broke at once and down they all fell into the land of po
and sometimes feasting and resting under the trees surrounding their grass houses hiku at last grew weary of the life by the sea he wanted the forest on the mountain and the cold stimulating air of the uplands
kahala bruised and broke as many of the leaves as she could quietly she was recognized at once as the child of the divine rain and wind of manoa valley there was no question concerning her bodily presence the torn leaves afforded ample and indisputable testimony
or praying to death the hawaiians said perhaps the priests of kalai pahoa put poison in bananas or in taro it was believed that they scraped the body of the image and put the pieces in the food of the one they wished to pray to death
then the joy of the people surpassed all the pleasure of all the days before for they looked upon the two most beautiful beings they had ever seen and believed that these two would make glad each other's lives
the father was very weak from hunger and longing for death and could scarcely listen to them when kane said have you love for your child the father whispered yes my love is without end can you go down into the dark land and get the spirit and put it back in the body which lies here
thus he went from place to place searching for his boy finding him at last as the hawaiians quaintly expressed it down in papa ku the established foundation of po
choking and suffocating from the bananas of ghost land which he was compelled to continually force into his mouth the father caught the spirit of the boy and started back toward the upper-world but the ghosts surrounded him they tried to catch him and take the spirit away from him
no the father said no i can only die and go to live with him and make him happier by taking him to a better place then the gods said we will give you the power to go after your boy and we will help you to escape the dangers of the land of ghosts

and how in despair she had taken her life the spirit going to the under-world hiku the child of the forest was overcome with grief he was ready to do anything to atone for the suffering he had caused
then the father stirred by hope rose up and took food and drink soon he was strong enough to go on his journey the gods gave him a ghost body and also prepared a hollow stick like bamboo in which they put food battle weapons and a piece of burning lava for fire
they have a story of a woman who like the rainbow maiden was restored to life several times the spirit of kahala was almost discouraged the shadows of real death were encompassing her and the feeling of separation from the body was becoming more and more permanent
they were very angry and ran out after the boy they caught him eating the bananas and killed him the body they left lying under the trees and taking out his ghost threw it into the underworld
thus she could aid her own cause and also protect the sister spirits slowly and with great dignity the beautiful rainbow maiden and her friends passed through the crowds of eager attendants to their places before the king
the father was very sorrowful and heavyhearted as he went on his way to his desolate home he searched for the body of his boy and at last found it he saw too that the story of the gods was true for partly eaten bananas filled the mouth which was set in death
she called for hiku again and again she called but hiku was gone she heard his footsteps as his eager tread shook the ground
he became angry with the rainbow maiden and killed her and buried the body but her guardian god pueo the owl scratched away the earth and brought her to life several times this occurred and the owl each time restored the buried body to the wandering spirit
the spirits of the dead chiefs challenged him when he passed their homes battle after battle was fought his magic club struck the warriors down and his spear tossed them aside sometimes he was warmly greeted and aided by ghosts of kindly spirit
one night hiku rose up very quietly and passed out into the darkness as he began to climb toward the uplands the leaves of the trees rustled loudly in welcome the night birds circled around him and hastened him on his way but kewalu was awakened
the rainbow the anuenue marks the continuation of the legendary life of kahala the legend of kahala is worthy of record in itself but connected with the story is a very interesting account of an attempt to discover and capture ghosts
one of the hawaiian writers said the opihiawa is a poison shellfish these are bitter and deadly and can be used in putting enemies to death
so calling her maidens she went down to the seashore and first saw hiku on the highest crest of the rolling surf she decided at once that she had never seen a man so comely and hiku surfing to the shore felt that he had never dreamed of such grace and beauty as marked the maiden who was coming to welcome him
the father toiled hour after hour cultivating his food plants and when wearied returned to his home on the way he met the two gods they told him how his boy had robbed them of their sacrifices and how they had punished him they said we have sent his ghost body to the lowest regions of the underworld
po was sometimes the underworld and milu was the god ruling over po the hawaiian ghosts did not go to the home of the dead as soon as they were separated from the body
it is said that the generations of their children gave many rulers to the hawaiians and that their present royal family the house of kalakaua is the last of the descendants
the rain was falling all around her and the way was very rough and hard she slipped and fell again and again the ancient chant connected with the legend says
at last she saw a noble young chief approaching he was mahana  the chief of the kamoiliili the spirit hovered over him and around him and tried to impress her anguish upon him mahana felt the call of distress and attributed it to the presence of a ghost

he needed merely to taste the food in his hollow cane to have new life and strength this he had done when he climbed the tree thus he had been able to push pass the fabled guardians of the pathway of the ghosts in the upperworld

in the realm of milu he saw the people in the game of rolling coconut shells to hit a post kulioe one of the spirits had been playing the kilu and had lost all his property to the daughter of milu and one of her friends he saw hiku and said if you are a skilful man perhaps you should play with these two girls
the samoans had the same thought concerning the restoration of life to one who had become unconscious and had a special prayer which was known as a prayer of life by which the spirit was persuaded to return to its home
kauhi was punished for his crimes against kahala he was baked alive in the imu prepared on his own land at waikiki his lands and retainers were given to kahala and mahana
again the same sound awakened his curiosity he now learned that it came from the distant seashore far below his home on the mountainside hiku of the forest called his mother and together they listened as again the strange sound from the beach rose along the mountain gulches and was echoed among the cliffs e hiku
so where he finds him under a mistake not to suffer that to pass without correction his answers to the foresaid questions i will read to you what is most ancient time what is greatest the world what is wisest truth what is most beautiful

fifthly cleobulus said where the rulers fear reproof and shame more than the law sixthly pittacus said where bad men are prohibited from ruling and good men from not ruling
to show what that measure is which may content any man cleobulus answered the law has prescribed a measure for wise men but as touching fools i will tell you a story i once heard my mother relate to my brother

i touched with pain her purity sin's darker sense i could not bring my soul was black as night to me to her i was a wounded thing i needed love no words could say

the christmas holidays is over i spent mine doing kitchen police the only thing what pealed for me christmas morning was potatoes and the only thing what rung out was dish cloths but i guess you ain't familiar enough with the poets to get that mable it shows that i can be funny an bright though even under adversary conditions

there's a fellow in town what says he'll send flowers anywhere you want by telegraph i was gonna send you some for christmas morning then i figured it was a silly idea in the first place they'd get smashed on the way and then you can't get enough flowers in one of them little envelopes to make one good smell
the other day he had some medicine for a cold it says on the bottle that it was seventeen percent alcohol he drank the whole thing right down so as nobody couldn't get hold of it it made him awful sick but he says that's because he is used to it for such a long time

they was quite a few things i didn't know even at that he said that the heavy artillery was commanded by the c c o d a and the light artillery by the c o a
the gas fellow said the other day that gas was perfectly safe cause you could always tell when it was comin' you could hear it escape or see it or smell it the only trouble was he said that when the gas started the machine guns made so much noise you couldn't hear it and it always came at night sos you couldn't see it and when you smelled it it was most to late to bother anyhow
army food always runs cooks love loose grub they're awful stupid if there's anything solid you get it in the pan with the rim on it then they pour the soup on your cover when you sit down half of what you got left spills out on the table it isn't so bad now cause everything freezes about as soon as it hits
day after tomorrow's inspection they do it every saturday that's another thing i'm thankful for there's only one saturday a week we pull everything out and pile it on our cots then the captain and the sergeant comes in
he's a human being even if he is a captain mable so every time i saw him i used to stop him and talk to him democratic that's me all over mable smith he says if they was all like you round here war would be hell no joke by which he meant that we would make it hot for the boshes

here the thunder of the guns smashing down the german huns and the sticky pools of gory blood soaking up the oozy sod the rushing roaring shrieking boom of bullets crashing through the gloom
and rodolphe imperceptibly glided from the footstool to the ground but a sound of wooden shoes was heard in the kitchen and he noticed the door of the room was not closed
the bottom of the hill rodolphe gave his horse its head they started together at a bound then at the top suddenly the horses stopped and her large blue veil fell about her
this first piece of daring successful now every time charles went out early emma dressed quickly and slipped on tip down steps that led to the waterside but when the plank for the cows was taken up she had to go by the walls alongside of the river
the day following passed with a new sweetness they made vows to one another she told him of her sorrows rodolphe interrupted her with kisses and she looking at him through half closed eyes asked him to call her again by her name to say that he loved her they were in the forest as yesterday in the shed of some wooden shoe
she was charming on horseback upright with her slender waist her knee bent on the mane of her horse her face somewhat flushed by the fresh air in the red of the evening on entering yonville she made her horse prance in the road people looked at her from the windows
it was early in october there was fog over the land hazy clouds hovered on the horizon between the outlines of the hills others rent asunder floated up and disappeared
her face appeared in a bluish transparency as if she were floating under azure waves but where are we going he did not answer she was breathing irregularly
he again became respectful caressing timid she gave him her arm they went back he said what was the matter with you why
you here you here he repeated how did you manage to come ah your dress is damp i love you she answered throwing her arms about his neck
clumps of trees here and there stood out like black rocks and the tall lines of the poplars that rose above the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind by the side on the turf between the pines a brown light shimmered in the warm atmosphere the earth
but her long habit got in her way although she held it up by the skirt and rodolphe walking behind her saw between the black cloth and the black shoe the fineness of her white stocking that seemed to him as if it were a part of her nakedness
why can you not guess he looked at her again but so hard that she lowered her head blushing he went on emma sir she said drawing back a little ah you see replied he in a melancholy
on his good nature next day at noon rodolphe appeared at charles's door with two saddle horses one had pink rosettes at his ears and deerskin side saddle rodolphe
this idea made her pant with desire and she soon found herself in the middle of the field walking with rapid steps without looking behind her day was just breaking emma from afar recognised her lover's house its two dove-tailed weathercocks stood out black against the pale dawn beyond the farmyard there was a detached building
yes i think of it constantly the memory of you drives me to despair ah forgive me i will leave you farewell i will go far away so far that you will never hear of me again and yet
how kind it would be of you he went on rising if you would humour a whim of mine it was to go over her house he wanted to know it and madame bovary seeing no objection to this they both rose when charles came in
the walls were of straw and the roof so low they had to stoop they were seated side by side on a bed of dry leaves from that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every evening emma placed her letter at the end of the garden by the river and
her mother answered with a wave of her whip a pleasant ride cried monsieur homais prudence above all prudence and he flourished his newspaper as he saw them disappear
often in the thicket was heard the fluttering of wings or else the hoarse soft cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks they dismounted rodolphe fastened up the horses she walked on in front on the moss between the paths
he advanced with outstretched arms she recoiled trembling she stammered oh you frighten me you hurt me let me go if it must be he went on his face changing
oh rodolphe said the young woman slowly leaning on his shoulder the cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat she threw back her white neck swelling with a sigh and a faltering in tears with long shudder and hiding her face
sometimes through a rift in the clouds beneath a ray of sunshine gleamed from afar the roots of yonville with the gardens at the water's edge the yards the walls and the church steeple
the bank was slippery in order not to fall she caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers then she went across ploughed fields in which she sank stumbling and clogging her thin shoes her scarf knotted round her head
then she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read and the lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her memory with the voice of sisters that charmed her
and he knew that his calculation had been right when on entering the room he saw emma turn pale she was alone the day was drawing in the small muslin curtain along the windows deepened the twilight
at dinner her husband thought she looked well but she pretended not to hear him when he inquired about her ride and she remained sitting there with her elbow at the side of her plate between the two lighted candles
he added and thinking it might please you i have bespoken it bought it have i done right do tell me she nodded her head in assent then a quarter of an hour later
the yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy whitish light enter softly emma felt about opening and closing her eyes while the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed as it were a topaz aureole around her face rodolphe laughing drew her to him and pressed her to his breast
he did not begin by frightening her with compliments he was calm serious melancholy emma listened to him with bowed head and stirred the bits of wood on the ground with the tip of her foot but at the words
she became herself as it were an actual part of these imaginings and realised the love dream of her youth as she saw herself in this type of amorous women whom she had so envied besides emma felt a satisfaction of revenge
she stopped i am tired she said come try again he went on courage then some hundred paces farther on she again stopped and through her veil that fell sideways from her man's hat over her hips
the sky was now blue the leaves no longer stirred there were spaces full of heather in flower and plots of violets alternated with the confused patches of the trees that were grey fawn or golden coloured according to the nature of their leaves
took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye then emma cried she would have wished never to leave rodolphe something stronger than herself forced her to him so much so that one day seeing her come unexpectedly he frowned as one put out
rodolphe looked round him biting his moustache they came to a larger space where the coppice had been cut they sat down at the trunk of a fallen tree and rodolphe began speaking to her of his love
she gave herself up to him-the shades of night were falling
at the end of a week he had gone off hunting after the hunting he had thought it was too late and then he reasoned thus if from the first day she loved me she must from impatience to see me again love me more let's go on with it
it was the first time that emma had heard such words spoken to herself and her pride like one who reposes bathed in warmth expanded softly and fully at this glowing language
emma half closed her eyes to pick out her house and never had this poor village where she lived appeared so small from the height on which they were the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake sending off its vapour into the air
fluttered to the wind in the meadows she was afraid of the oxen she began to run she arrived out of breath with rosy cheeks and breathing out from the whole person a fresh perfume of sap of verdure of the open air at this hour rodolphe still slept it was like a spring morning coming into his room
she felt her heart whose beating had begun again and the blood coursing through her flesh like a stream of milk then far away beyond the wood on the other hills she heard a vague prolonged cry a voice which lingered
azure infinity encompassed her the heights of sentiment sparkled under her thought and ordinary existence appeared only afar off down below in the shade through the interspaces of these heights
long ferns by the roadside caught in emma's stirrup rodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along at other times to turn aside the branches he passed close to her and emma felt his knee brushing against her leg
but i need you to live i must have your eyes your voice your thought my friend my sister my angel and he put out his arm round her waist she feebly tried to disengage herself he supported her thus as they walked along
today i know not what force impelled me towards you for one does not struggle against heaven one cannot resist the smile of angels one is carried away by that which is beautiful charming adorable
felt the pressure of his arm while the leaves rustled and the reeds whistled but when she saw herself in the glass she wondered at her face never had her eyes been so large so black of so profound a depth
then she examined the apartment opened the drawers of the tables combed her hair with his comb and looked at herself in his shaving-glass often she even put between teeth big pipe that lay on the table by the bed amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near a bottle of water
justin escaped from the chemist's to see her start and the chemist also came out he was giving monsieur boulanger a little good advice an accident happens so easily be careful your horses perhaps are mettlesome she heard a noise above her it was felicite drumming the windowpanes to amuse little berthe the child blew her a kiss
well what the deuce do i care for that said charles making a pirouette health before everything you are wrong and how do you think i can ride when i haven't got a habit you must order one he answered the riding-habit decided her when the habit was ready charles wrote to monsieur boulanger that his wife was at his command and that
the chateau she entered it was if the doors at her approach had opened wide of their own accord a large straight staircase led up to the corridor emma raised the latch of a door and suddenly at the end of the room she saw a man sleeping it was rodolphe she uttered a cry
the horizontal sun passing between the branches dazzle the eyes here and there around her the leaves or on the ground trembled luminous patches as if hummingbirds flying about had scattered their feathers silence was everywhere something sweet seemed to come forth from the trees
as soon as he felt the ground emma's horse set off at a gallop rodolphe galloped by her side now and then they exchanged a word her figure slightly bent her hand well up and her right arm stretched out she gave herself up to the cadence of the movement that rocked her in her saddle
what is the matter with you she said are you ill tell me at last he declared with a serious air
she turned towards him with a sob oh you are good she said no i love you that is all you do not doubt that tell me one word only one word
the traces of their horses side by side the same thickets the same stones to the grass nothing around them seemed changed and yet for her something had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved in their places rodolphe now and again bent forward and took her hand to kiss it
emma he said what well i spent the afternoon at monsieur alexandre's he has an old cob still very fine only a little broken-kneed and that could be bought i am sure for a hundred crowns
six weeks passed rodolphe did not come again at last one evening he appeared the day after the show he had said to himself we mustn't go back too soon that would be a mistake
and the little lamp a gleam shining through windowpanes in the darkness ah you never knew that there so near you so far from you was a poor wretch
good morning doctor rodolphe said to him the doctor flattered at this unexpected title launched out into obsequious phrases of this the other took advantage to pull himself together a little
no i'll send him to you we'll come that will be more convenient for you ah very good i thank you and as soon as they were alone why don't you accept monsieur boulanger's kind offer she assumed a sulky air invented a thousand excuses and finally declared that perhaps it would look odd
just as they were entering the forest the sun shone out god protects us said rodolphe do you think so she said forward forward he continued he tchked with his tongue the two beasts set off at a trot
aren't our destinies now one oh no she replied you know that well it is impossible she rose to go he seized her by the wrist she stopped then having gazed at him for a few moments with an amorous and humid look she said hurriedly
voice that i was right not to come back for this name this name that fills my whole soul and that escaped me you forbid me to use madame
rodolphe and emma thus went along the skirt of the wood she turned away from time to time to avoid his look and then she saw only the pine trunks in lines whose monotonous succession made her a little giddy the horses were panting the leather of the saddles creaked
but they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves oh one moment said rodolphe do not let us go stay
had put on high soft boots saying to himself that no doubt she had never seen anything like them in fact emma was charmed with his appearance as he stood on the landing in his great velvet coat and white corduroy breeches she was ready she was waiting for him
fissure of the wall rodolphe came to fetch it and put another there that she always found fault with as too short one morning when charles had gone out before day break she was seized with the fancy to see rodolphe at once she would go quickly to la huchette stay there an hour and be back again at yonville while everyone was still asleep
delighting at the idea that a second puberty had come to her so at last she was to know those joys of love that fever of happiness of which she had despaired she was entering upon marvels where all would be passion ecstasy delirium
ah do not speak of it again where are the horses let us go back he made a gesture of anger and annoyance she repeated where are the horses where are the horses then smiling a strange smile his pupil fixed his teeth set
the gilding of the barometer on which the rays of the sun fell shone in the looking glass between the meshes of the coral rodolphe remained standing and emma hardly answered his first conventional phrases
i he said i've been busy i have been ill seriously she cried well said rodolphe sitting down at her side on a footstool no it was because i didn't want to come back
but if i did not come he continued if i could not see you least i have gazed along on all surrounds you at night every night i arose i came hither i watched you house its glimmering in the moon the trees in the garden swaying before your window
why all the world calls you thus besides it is not your name it is the name of another he repeated of another and he hid his face in his hands
he always brought his machine to school but he very seldom used it at the beginning of the unexplored country an irresponsible person recommended him to go straight on he couldn't miss the road said he it was straight all the way
then he looked earnestly at the bicycle and finally in perfect silence began to inspect the bishop again eh he said at length can you tell me the way to anfield anfield yes how do i get there the man perpent
one curved gently off to the right the other two equally gently to the left he dismounted and the feelings of gratitude which he had borne towards his informant
farnie using his out of bounds adventures as a foundation worked up a highly artistic narrative of doings which if they had actually been performed would certainly have entailed expulsion he had judged gethryn's character correctly
farnie was reading one of those halfpenny weeklies which with a nerve which is the only credible thing about them call themselves comic he did not see the bishop until the shadow falling across his paper caused him to look up it was not often that he found himself unequal to a situation
and he saw a bad time coming for himself in the very near future either he must expose farnie which he had resolved not to do or he must refuse to explain his absence from the m c c match for by now there was not the smallest chance of his being able to get back in time for the visitors innings
they had looked like making a big score when he had left the ground in which case public opinion would be more lenient towards him after a victory a school feels that all's well that ends well but it might on the other hand mean quite the reverse
the bishop passed through old inns with some way on his machine he had much lost time to make up a signpost bearing the legend anfield four miles told him that he was nearing his destination
as he rode on he tried to imagine what would happen in consequence of that desertion and he could not do it his crime was so far as he knew absolutely without precedent in the school history as they passed the cricket field he saw that it was empty stumps were usually drawn early
a sign-post informed him of three things by following road one he might get to brindleham and ultimately if he persevered to corden
the first thing that caught his eye was the station clock with its hands pointing to five past four and then he realized that his uncle's train having left a clear half hour before his labours had all been for nothing
i say can you tell me the way to anfield please said the bishop as he came up the man stopped apparently rooted to the spot he surveyed the bishop with a glassy but determined stare from head to foot
it's the other chaps i'm thinking about you'll find it jolly hard to put norris off i'm afraid he's most awfully sick about the match he fielded badly which always makes him shirty jephson too you'll have a bad time with jephson
the full bitterness of life came home to him he was turning away from the station when he stopped something else had caught his eye on a bench at the extreme end of the platform sat a youth and a further scrutiny convinced the bishop of the fact that the youth was none other
try atorealize what you've done do you grasp the fact that you've gone and got the school licked in the m c c match and that we haven't beaten the m c c for about a dozen years and that if you'd been there to bowl we should have walked over this time
this was not strictly true monk had not said he had hinted and he had hinted at flogging not expulsion why pursued the bishop what had you and monk been up to
and when he replied did so after the style of the late and great ollendorf old inns he said dreamily waving a hand down the road by which he had come be over there yes yes i know said gethryn was born at old inns i was continued the man
where the dickens have you been all the afternoon what on earth did you go off like that for i'm sorry old chap said the bishop i can't tell you i shan't be able to tell anyone but man
his progress was not rapid half an hour before his one wish had been to catch sight of a fellow being now when he would have preferred to have avoided his species men seemed to spring up from nowhere and every man
it looks so much better don't you think so why did they let you out goodbye and feeling a little more comfortable after this outburst he wheeled his bicycle on into anfield high street minds in the village of anfield worked with extraordinary rapidity
and lesser middlefold in the vale but on the subject of anfield and anfield junction the board was silent two courses lay open to him should he select a route at random or wait for somebody to come and direct him he waited
in the m c c match at the issue of the game was out of doubt as the marylebone men had trains to catch evidently this had happened today it might mean that the school had won easily
of them had a remark to make or a question to ask about the punctured tyre reserve is not the leading characteristic of an average yokel gethryn however refused to be drawn into conversation on the subject at last one
the notice had changed to three miles and again to two when suddenly he felt that jarring sensation which every cyclist knows his back tire was punctured it was impossible to ride on he got off and walked he was still in his cricket clothes and the fact that he had on spiked boots did not make walking any the easier
he put his machine up and hurried to the study several boys as he passed them looked curiously at him but none spoke to him marriott was in the study reading a book
i don't want to know the way to old inns he said desperately where i want to get is anfield anfield you know which way do i go anfield said the man then a bright flash of intelligence illumined his countenance
more determined than the rest brought him to bay hoy mister stop called a voice gethryn turned a man was running up the road towards him he arrived panting what's up said the bishop you've got a puncture said the man pointing an accusing finger at the flattened tire
for his lucid directions vanished suddenly he gazed searchingly at the three roads but to single out one of them as straighter than the other two was a task that baffled him completely
he went on waiting he waited a considerable time and at last just as he was about to trust to luck and make for much middlefold on the hill a figure loomed in sight a slow moving man who strolled down the old inns road at a pace which seemed to argue that he had plenty of time on his hands
leaving the roads covered with small thorns it was the former of these circumstances that first made itself apparent for two miles the road ran straight but after that it was unexplored country the bishop being in both cricket and football teams had few opportunities for cycling
monk in a recent conversation had taken him aback somewhat but his feelings on that occasion were not to be compared with what he felt on seeing the one person whom he least desired to meet standing at his side
this is all rot you can't do a thing like this and then refuse to offer any explanation and expect things to go on just as usual i don't said gethryn i know there's going to be a row but i can't explain
the first person of whom he asked the way to the junction answered the riddle almost without thinking he left his machine out in the road and went on to the platform
oh said gethryn as they were about to mount there's that money i was forgetting out with it ten pounds had been the sum farnie had taken from the study six was all he was able to restore gethryn enquired after the deficit i gave it to monk said farnie
gethryn thanked him rode on and having gone a mile came upon three roads each of which might quite well have been considered a continuation of the road on which he was already
to gethryn in his present frame of mind the mere mention of monk was sufficient to uncork the vials of his wrath what the blazes did you do that for what's monk got to do with it he said he'd get me sacked if i didn't pay him whined farnie
if the matter had been simply a case for a flogging the bishop would have stood aside and let the thing go on against the extreme penalty of school law he felt bound as a matter of family duty to shield his relative
he was still in flannels and looked as if he had begun to change but had thought better of it as was actually the case hello he cried as gethryn appeared
get up he said farnie got up come on farnie came go and get your machine said gethryn hurry up and now you will jolly well come back to beckford you little beast but before that could be done there was gethryn's back wheel to be mended this took time it was nearly half past four before they started
you'll have to take me on trust oh as far as i am concerned it's all right said marriott i know you wouldn't be ass enough to do a thing like that without a jolly good reason
when he would have to meet norris and the rest it would have been bad in any case he did not care to think what would happen when he refused to offer the slightest explanation end of chapter nine
his one wish after the match was to have your gore and plenty of it nothing else would have pleased him a bit and think of the chaps in the house too just consider what a pull this gives monk and his mob over you the house will want some looking after now i fancy
and they'll get it said gethryn if monk gives me any of his beastly cheek i'll knock his head off but in spite of the consolation which which such a prospect afforded him he did not look forward with pleasure to the next day
his jaw dropped limply comic blitherings fluttered to the ground the bishop was the first to speak indeed if he had waited for farnie to break the silence he would have waited long
do try and grasp the thing did they win rather by a wicket two wickets i mean we made two one three your bowling would just have done it gethryn sat down oh lord he said blankly this is awful but look here bishop continued marriott

but i was scared to say nothing about that there cistern so i just bawled some more was it in the blacksmith shop says ms alexander i nodded my head again and let it go at that is he in there now asked ms alexander i nodded again
just then old miss rogers which is one of our neighbours comes by while elmira is shaking me and yelling what did i mean and how did it happen and had i saw it and where was hank's corpse and miss rogers she says what's danny been doing now elmira me being always up to something elmira she turned around and seen her and she gives a whoop and then hollers out
hank he scratches his head for he's kind of confuddled and thinks maybe he really has brought this basket with him he tries to think of all the places he has been that night but he can't think of any place but bill nolan's saloon so he says elmira honest i ain't had but one drink all day
but they ate him up and they was gaining again for the smell of human blood was on the plains of oregon he says and the sight of his mother's face when she asked him never to be a cowboy come to him in the moonlight and he knowed that somehow all would yet be well
then i got right mad and i run in on him again and this time i got to him and wrastled with him well sir i never was so surprised in all my life before for i hadn't had hold on him more'n a minute before i seen i'm stronger than hank is
elmira sings out hank mad and bossy you go get me a ladder but elmira her temper riz up too all of a sudden don't you dare order me around like i was the dirt under your feet hennerey walters she says
and then he kinda rouses up a little bit and gets surprised and says that a baby you got there elmira and then he says dignified so far as that's concerned elmira where did you get that there baby
and just as hank made that mark he spoke some words over him and then he says now henry walters i have baptized you and you are a member of the church you'd a thought hank would of broke out cussing again at being took unexpected that a way for he hadn't really agreed to nothing but signing the pledge but nary a cuss
well one night he says they was an awful fight on the plains of oregon wherever them is and he got plugged full of bullet holes and his hoss run away with him and he was carried off and the hoss was going at a dead run
so he didn't wake up till we hitched him up he says he will ride around to the shop with me but jake says it's all right see i'll go over myself and fetch him back purty soon which he was wore out with being up so late the night before and goes back to sleep again right off
i throwed him and he hit the ground with considerable of a jar and then i put my knee in the pit of his stomach and churned it a couple and i thinks to myself what a fool i must of been fur better'n a year because i might of done this any time
hank he looks at me like i'd asked for a house and lot or a million dollars or something like that but he don't say nothing he just snorts hank i says i been doing right smart work around the shop for two three years now if you wasn't loafing so much you'd a noticed it more and i ain't never ask for a cent of pay for it nor you ain't worth no pay says hank you ain't worth nothing but to eat vittles and wear out clothes
hank's father had built that cistern and one time he brung home some live fish in a bucket and dumped them in there and they growed and they multiplied in there and refurnished the earth
so when she grabs hold of me and asks me again what did i mean i blubbered harder just the way a kid will and says nothing else i wish i hadn't set them flatirons on that door for it come to me all at once that even if hank has turned into a corpse i ain't got any right to keep him in that sister
hank he gets up and then he sets down sudden on a horse block and wipes his face on his sleeve which they was considerable blood come onto the sleeve i looks around to see who has had hold of me and it is two men one of them looks about seven feet tall on account of a big plug hat and a long white linen duster and has a beautiful red beard
are your teeth coated does your hair come out when you comb it is your breath short when you walk up stairs do your feet swell in warm weather are there white spots on your fingernails do you draw your breath part of the time through one nostril and part of the time through the other do you ever have a nightmare
you never fought it out fair and square neither man playing to outlast man like you done with this here pledge but you sneaked it in on me when i wasn't looking there was a lot of men in that crowd that thought the preacher had went too far and sympathized with hank the way he done about that hurt brother cartwright in our town
and i couldn't keep my eyes off'n him does your heart beat fast when you exercise he asks the crowd is your tongue coated after meals do your eyes leak when your nose is stopped up do you perspire under your armpits do you ever have a ringing in your ears does your stomach hurt after meals does your back ever ache do you ever have pains in your legs do your eyes blur when you look at the sun
elmira looks into the basket they was one of them long rubber tubes stringing out of a bottle that was in it and i had been sucking that bottle when interrupted and they wasn't nothing else in that basket but a big thick shawl which had been wrapped all around me and elmira often wore it to a meeting afterward
hank he rose up then and he says mister be you a preacher cause if you be the sooner you have drove on the better for ye i got a grudge against all preachers that feller he just looks hank over calm and easy and slow before he answers and he wrinkles up his face like he never seen anything like hank before then he fetches a kind of aggravating smile and he says
i never know they was so many diseases nor yet so many things to have them in well i was feeling pretty good when the show started but the doc he kept looking right at me every now and then when he talked
so along about ten o'clock he sings out i give in gosh dern ye i give in let me out and i'll sign your pesky pledge brother cartwright was for getting a ladder and letting him climb out right away but elmira she says don't you do it brother cartwright don't you do it you don't know hank walters like i does if he once gets out o there before he's signed that pledge he won't never sign it
in the road they is a big stout road wagon with a canopy top over it pulled by two horses and on the wagon box they is a strip of canvas which i couldn't read then what was wrote on the canvas but i learnt later it said in big print
i thinks that lamming is about due now but whilst all eyes is turned on me and elmira they comes a voice from that cistern it is hank's voice and he sings out tom alexander is that you some of the women scream for some thinks it is hank's ghost but one woman says what would a ghost be doing in a cistern
beneath a shady chestnut tree the village blacksmith stands the smith a pleasant soul is he with warts upon his hands he stares at hank hard and solemn and serious while he is saying that poetry at him hank fidgets and turns his eyes away but the feller touches him on the breast with his finger and makes him look at him
and i had some of 'em yet i begun to feel kinda sick and looking at them organs and diseases didn't help me none either the doctor he lit out on another string of symptoms and i had them too seems to me i had purty nigh everything but fits kidney complaint and consumption both had a holt on me
the first thing you knowed they was a regular revival meeting there and that preacher was preaching a regular revival sermon i been to more than one camp meeting but for just naturally taking hold of the whole human race by the slack of its pants and dangling of it over hell fire i never heard nothing could come up to that there sermon
fur now i've licked hank oncet i figger he won't rest till he has wiped that disgrace out and he won't care a dern what he picks up to do it with nuther they was a crick about a hundred yards from our house in the woods and i went over there and laid down and watched it run by
you come here and take off your shirt but i just moves away hank he runs in on me and he swings his strap i throwed up my arm and it cut me across the knuckles i run in on him and he dropped the strap and fetched me an openhanded smack plumb on the mouth that jarred my head back and like to of busted it loose
but i ain't got no money i says and i was gonna ast you could you spare me half a dollar great jehosephat says hank but ain't you gettin' stuck up what's the matter of you crawlin' in under the tent like you always done
i laid awful still thinking i wished i was away from that town pretty soon a squirrel comes down and sets on a log and watches me i throwed an acorn at him and he scooted up a tree quicker'n scat and then i wished i hadn't scared him away for it looked like he knowed i was in trouble
that was before siwash injun sagraw was ever found out about doctor kirby broke down and cried right there in the wagon when he thought of how his father might of been saved if he was only alive now that that medicine was put up into bottle form six for a five dollar bill so long as he was in town and after that two dollars for each bottle at the drug store
but elmira only answers you wasn't sober when you fell into there hennerey walters and now you can just stay in there till you get a better temper on you and all the women says that's right elmira spunk up to him
well they played a purty close game of poker in our little town it was jest like the doctor says to looey by george he says it is a why nell perfect thing if you lose you lose and if you win you lose
hank is a corpse says i blubbering a corpse says elmira dropping her coffee which she was carrying home from the general store and post office danny what do you mean i seen i was to blame somehow and i wished then i hadn't said nothing about hank being a corpse and i made up my mind i wouldn't say nothing more
chapter one  how i come not to have a last name is a question that has always had more or less aggravation mixed up with it i might of had one just as well as not if old hank walters hadn't been so all fired infernal bullheaded about things in general and his wife elmira a blame sight worse
at that hank fairly roared he was so mad he says elmira when i get out'n here i'll give you what you won't forget in a hurry i hearing you a forgiving me and a-weeping over me and i won't be forgived nor weeped over by no one you go and get that ladder
by and by tom alexander come busting into the house and his wife ms alexander was with him what's the matter with all you folks he says they ain't nobody hanging in that there blacksmith shop i broke the door down and went in and it was empty
first thing i know you'll be wanting a pair of these here yaller shoes and a stovepipe hat no says i i ain't no dude hank and you know it but they is always things about a circus to spend money on besides just the circus herself they is the side show for instance and they is the grand concert afterward i calculated i'd take 'em all in this year the whole dern thing just fur oncet
two or three old backsliders in the crowd come right up and repented all over again on the spot the whole kill and billing of 'em got the power good and hard like they does at camp meetings and revivals but hank he only cussed he was obstinate hank was and his pride and dander had riz up
she seen she had a piece of news and she's bound to be the first to spread it like they is always a lot of women wants to be in them country towns she run right cross that road to where the alexanders lived miss alexander she seen her coming and unhooked the screen door and miss rogers she
you never seen the day you could do it says tom alexander meaning the day he could lick him and if you feel that way about it you can stay there for all of me i guess a little water won't hurt you none and he left the house
so long as hank has turned into a corpse and that makes him dead what's the difference whether he's in the blacksmith shop or not for i hadn't had any plain idea being such a little kid that a corpse meant to be dead and wasn't sure what being dead was like neither except they had funerals over you then
it was about a even bet which would get me first i kind of got to wondering which i figured from what he said i'd had consumption the longest while but my kind of kidney trouble was an awful sly kind and i was liable to jump in without no warning at all and just naturally wipe me out quick so i sort of bet on the kidney trouble
look at this here hotel and livery stable danny twenty years ago i didn't have no more'n you've got danny but i always went by them mottoes hard work and bein' honest you got to nail them shoes on danny and fix that wheel
he had won from jake smith which run it and from the others but shucks it never made no difference what you won in that crowd they had done doctor kirby and looey like they always done a drummer or a stranger that come along into that town and was fool enough to play poker with them
she might of banged him one the same as usual and got her own eye blacked also the same as usual but just then i lets out another big yowl and she give me some milk
each woman took hern and one woman a sipping of hern she says the departed had his good pints elmira which was the best thing had been said of hank in that town for years and years
and both of them ready to row at a minute's notice and stick to it forevermore hank he was considerable of a lusher one saturday night when he come home from the village in his usual fix
did your nose bleed easily when you were growing up does your skin fester when scratched are your eyes gummy in the mornings then he says if you have any or all of these symptoms your blood is bad and your liver is wasting away well sir i seen i was in a bad way for at one time or another i had had most of them there signs and warnings and i hadn't heeded em
they was considerable splashing around in the water for a couple of minutes and then all of a sudden a live fish come a-whirling out of that hole which he had catched it with his hands it was a big bullhead and its whiskers around its mouth was stiffened into spikes
then they was a pretty howdy-do and they all sings out where's the corpse and some thinks maybe some one has cut it down and took it away and all gabbles to oncet but for a minute no one thinks maybe little danny has been egged on to tell lies little danny ain't saying a word but elmira she grabs me and shakes me and she says you little liar you what do you mean by that tale you told
hollers out before she reached the porch hank walters is dead and then she went footing it up the street they was a black plume on her bonnet which nodded the same as on a hearse and she was into and out of seven front yards in five minutes
with shows and electric belts and things that they got to stop dreening that town of hard earned money and he has decided to make an example of em the only two lawyers in town is windy and mart which has been in the poker game theirselves the same as always the doctor says the whole thing is a put up job and he can't get the money and he wouldn't if he could
and hank would just cuss and cuss every time he busted out into another cussing spell they would start another hymn finally the men out in the front yard got warmed up too and begun to sing all but bill nolan's crowd and they gave hank up for lost and went away disgusted
get me a ladder gol dern you and i'll come out'n here and learn you to brother me i will only that wasn't nothin' to what hank really said to that preacher no more like it than a little yaller fluffy canary is like a buzzard brother walters says the preacher calm but firm we have all decided that you ain't gonna come out of that cistern till you sign the pledge
then the drummer or whoever it was would be took to the calaboose and spend all night there in the morning they would be took before squire matthews that was justice of the peace they would be fined a big fine and he would get all the drummer had won and all he had brung to town with him besides
well the doctor he had started out winning the night before and si emery and ralph scott had arrested them and that morning while i had been laying by the crick and the rest of the town was seeing the fun they had been took afore squire matthews and fined one hundred and twenty-five dollars apiece
he unrolled a big chart and the injun helt it by that there gasoline lamp so all could see turning the pages now and then it was a map of a man's inside organs and digestive ornaments and things they was red and blue like each organ's own disease had turned it and some of em was yaller and they was a long string of diseases printed in black hanging down from each organ's picture
tom alexander he laughs and he says what in blazes you want to jump in there for hank you darn idiot says hank you quit mocking me and get a ladder and when i get out in here i'll learn you to ask what did i want to jump in here for
all right doc but it's no use talking you can talk all right we all know that the question is how are we going to get our horses and wagon away from these rubes i listens some more and i seen them fellers was really into bad trouble doctor kirby he had got into a poker game at smith's palace hotel the night before right after the show
ourn worked the same but our cistern was right in under our kitchen floor and they was a trap door with leather hinges opened into it right by the kitchen stove but that wasn't why i was so proud of it it was because that cistern was just plumb full of fish bullheads and red horse and sunfish and other kinds
and the blood was running down onto the ground and the wolves smelt the blood and took out after him yipping and yowling something frightful to hear and the hoss he kicked out behind and killed the head wolf and the others stopped to eat him up and while they was eating him the hoss gained a quarter of a mile
but the kick was already started into the air and when he turns he can't stop it and so hank gets twisted and falls down and steps on himself that basket lets out a yowl it's kittens says hank still setting down and staring at that there basket all of which you understand i am a-telling you from hearsay as the lawyers always asts you in court
brother cartwright he steps up to the hole in the floor when he first comes in and says gentle like and soothing like a undertaker when he tells you where to set at a home funeral brother walters brother hank yells out don't you brother me you sniffling psalm singing yaller faced pigeon-toed hypocrite you
and purty soon i thinks what am i going to do for hank will be so mad when i let him up he'll just naturally kill me without i kill him and i was scared because i don't want neither one of them things to happen whilst i was thinking it over and getting scareder and scareder and banging hank's head harder and harder someone grabs me from behind they was two of them and one gets my collar and one gets the seat of my pants and they drug me off'n him
but she leaves the door open and goes on a-making tea and they ain't skeercly a sound from the cistern only little ripply noises like it might have been fish pretty soon a woman says it has drawed elmira won't you have a cup elmira she kicked some more but she took hern
squire matthews and jake smith and windy goodell and mart watson which the two last was lawyers was always playing that there game on drummers that was fool enough to play poker hank he says he bet they divided it up afterwards though it was supposed them fines went to the town
she looks at him and she sees he don't really know where i come from old hank mostly was truthful when liquored up for that matter and she knowed it for he couldn't think up no lies excepting a general denial when intoxicated up to the gills
elmira walters that was elmira appleton if you let hank out in that cistern before he has signed the pledge and promised to join the church you're a bigger fool then i take you to be a woman has got to make a stand
well alright jake says i if you feel that way about it just give me a chaw of tobacco and come around and help me hitch 'em up si emery was there asleep on a pile of straw guarding that property but ralph scott wasn't around
they wasn't a chancet fur an outsider if the drummer lost they would take his money and that would be all they was to it but if the drummer got to winning good some one would slip out'n the hotel and tell si emery which was the city marshal
siwash indian sagraw nature's universal medicinal specific discovered by dr hartley l kirby among the aborigines of oregon on account of being so busy neither hank nor me had hearing the wagon come along the road and stop the big man in the plug hat he says or they was words to that effect just as serious why are you mauling that aged gent
he stumbled over a basket that was setting on his front steps then he got up and drawed back his foot unsteady to kick it plumb into kingdom come just then he hearing elmira opening the door behind him and he turned his head sudden
finally he says you're taking a ornery low down advantage of me you are let me out in this here cistern and i'll show you who'll stick it out longest on dry land darn your religious hides
old miss primrose she always prided herself on being honest no matter what come and she ups and says i don't believe in no hippercritics at a time like this no more'n no other time the departed wasn't no good and the whole town knowed it
they was one thing in that house i always admired when i was a kid and that was a big cistern most people had their cisterns outside their house and they is a tin pipe takes all the rain water off the roof and scoots it into them
hank is dead and throws her apron over her head and sets right down in the path and boo hoos like a baby and i bellers louder ms rogers she never waited to ask nothing more
i hadn't meant to give out no untrue stories but a kid will always tell a lie not meaning to tell one if you sort of invite him with questions like that and get him scared the way you're acting besides i says to myself
but i seen i was a goner and i forgive hank all his orneriness for a feller don't wanna die holding grudges taking it the whole way through that was about the best medicine show i ever seen but they didn't sell much all the people had any money was to the circus again that night so they sung some more songs and closed early and went into the hotel
so they done it they went and they come back with vittles and they made up hot coffee and they feasted and that preacher and theirselves and elmira and me all right in hank's hearing and hank was getting hungry himself and he was cold in that water and the fish was nibbling at him and he was getting cussed out and weak and soaked full of despair and there wasn't no way for him to sit down and rest
hank he says all right and they done it but just as hank was making his mark on the leaf of the book that preacher done what i has always thought was a mean trick he was lying on the floor with his head and shoulders into that hole as far as he could holding a lantern way down into it so as hank could see
miss alexander she runs across the street to where we was and she kneels down and puts her arm around elmira which was still rocking back and forth in the path and she says how do you know he's dead elmira i seen him not more than an hour ago danny seen it all says elmira
and hank tells him what he thinks of pledges and him and church doings and it wasn't purty and he says if he was as deep in eternal fire as what he now is in rainwater and every fish that nibbles at his toes was a preacher with a red hot pitchfork a jabbing at him
the doctor he tells squire matthews it is an outrage and it ain't legal if tried in a bigger court and they ain't that much money in the world so for as he knows and he won't pay it but the squire he says the time has come to teach them travelling fakirs as is always running around the country
doctor he cusses the poker game and country towns and medicine shows and the hull creation and says he is so disgusted with life he guesses he'll go and be a preacher or a bearded lady in a sideshow but looey he don't cheer up none he says
ms alexander turned to me and wants to know what happened and how it happened and where it happened but i don't want to say nothing about that cistern so i busts out bellering fresher'n ever and i says he was drunk and he come home drunk and he done it then and that's how he cone it i says and you seen him she says i nodded where is he says she and elmira both to oncet
elmira she sings out kittens nothing it's a baby and she opens the basket and looks in and it was me hennerey walters she says picking me up and shaking me at him like i was a crime hennerey walters where did you get this here baby she always calls him hennerey when she is getting ready to give him fits
well says i he needed it considerable but says he still more solemn the good book says to honour thy father and thy mother well i says mebby it does and mebby it don't but he ain't my father nohow and he ain't been getting no more'n his come-uppings vengeance is mine saith the lord the big man remarks very serious
some of the folks there hadn't had no suppers so after all the other sinners but hank had either got converted or else sneaked away some of the women says why not make a kind of love feast out of it and bring some vittles like they does to church sociables because it seems likely satan is gonna wrestle all night long like he done with the angel jacob and they ought to be prepared
i got him by the ears and i slammed his head into the gravel a few times him a reaching for my throat and a pounding me with his fists but me a taking the licks and keeping holt and i had a mighty contested time for a few minutes there on top of hank chuckling to myself and batting him one every now and then for luck and trying to make him holler it's enough but hank is stubborn he won't holler
so they fixed it up that brother cartwright was to write out a pledge on the inside leaf of the bible and tie that bible onto a string and a lead pencil onto another string and let the strings down hank and he was  make his mark for he couldn't write and they was to be pulled up again
and he was scared of getting a cramp in his legs and sinking down with his head under water and being drownded he said afterward he'd of done the last with pleasure if they was any way of suing that crowd for murder
it is thus made evident these bodies act on polarized light in the manner of a crystal those that we show layman terms semi-liquid still present traces of polyhedric delimitation but with the peaks and angles rounded by surface tension while the others tend to a strictly spherical form
mostly scholars working in the physical laboratory of leyden under the guidance of the director mr kamerlingh onnes have endeavoured to verify the anticipations of the theory
professor van der waals arrived at this relation by relying upon considerations derived from the kinetic theory of gases if we keep to the simple idea at the bottom of this theory
to discover whether this supposition is correct it concerns us to compare the properties of liquids and solids if we find that all properties are common to the two states we have the right to believe
others again such as the study of the compressibility of water have a special interest on account of the peculiar properties of this substance mamagat by a very concise discussion of the experiments has also been able to definitely establish the laws of compressibility and dilatation of fluids under constant pressure
by equations termed conditions of equilibrium of the system if we reject this hypothesis it will then be allowable to introduce into thermodynamics laws previously excluded and it will be possible to construct as monsieur duhem has done a much more comprehensive theory
nickel steels present the most curious properties and i have already pointed out the paramount importance of one of them hardly capable of perceptible dilation for its application to metrology and chronometry others also discovered by m guillaume
the hypothesis of central forces a mere function of distance and has recognized a potential which depends on the relative orientation of the molecules these considerations also apply to the quasi isotropic bodies which are in fact networks of crystals
daily more numerous applications of the laws of corresponding states have rendered highly important the determination of the critical constants which permit these states to be defined in the case of homogeneous bodies the critical elements have a simple clear and precise sense
the very speed of their molecules may have reached a considerable value exceeding for instance eleven kilometres per second which suffices to explain why they should have left our atmosphere
between crystals and liquids in which bodies still retain a peculiar structure and consequently act on light nevertheless possess considerable plasticity let us note that the question of the continuity of the liquid and solid state
calculation has enabled monsieur van der waals by the application of his kinetic theories and monsieur duhem by means of thermodynamics to foresee most of the results which have since been verified by experiment
critical temperature is that of the single isothermal line which presents a point of inflexion at a horizontal tangent the critical pressure and the critical volume are the two coordinates of this point of inflexion
have given manifold examples of the fertility of these methods the question moreover has had a new light thrown upon it by the application of the principles of thermodynamics and of the phase rule
in the case of water for instance he finds that ordinary ice transforms itself under a given pressure at the temperature of minus eighty degrees celsius into another crystalline variety which is denser than water the statics of solids under high pressure is as yet therefore
these cases must naturally be governed by very complex laws recent researches by messrs van der waals alexeif rothmund kunen lehfeld etc throw however some light on the question
their composition may thus be very complex but gibbs' rule gives us at once important information on the point since it indicates that there cannot exist in general more than two distinct solutions in an alloy of two metals
but in very different conditions as regards their critical points from the experimental point of view m amagat has been able with extreme skill to conquer the most serious difficulties
in his famous theory of capillarity reduced the effect of the molecular attraction to a perpendicular pressure exercised on the surface of a liquid this leads him to add to the external pressure that due to the reciprocal attractions of the gaseous particles
we might think that a similar continuity ought to be there met with that the universal character of the properties of matter forbade all real discontinuity between two different states and that in truth the solid was a prolongation of the liquid state
but liquid air is costly and if one were content to evaporate it for the purpose of collecting a part of oxygen in the residuum the process would have a very poor result from the commercial point of view
the study of alloys in general is moreover one of those in which the introduction of the methods of physics has produced the greatest effects by the microscopic examination of a polished surface or of one indented by a reagent by the determination of the electromotive force of elements of which an alloy forms one of the poles
and the carlsruhe professor had to devise an ingenious apparatus which enabled him to bring the preparation at the required temperature on to the very plate of the microscope
all these gases are monoatomic like mercury that is to say they are in the most simple state they possess no internal molecular energy unless it is that which heat is capable of supplying and they even seem to have no chemical energy
a tube with electrodes enables the spectrum of gas in process of distillation to be observed in this manner the spectra of the gases may be seen following one another in the inverse order of their volatility
sir james dewar has effected careful measurements of the dilation of certain bodies at low temperatures for example of ice changes in colour occur and vermilion and iodide of mercury pass into pale orange phosphorescence becomes more intense and most bodies of complex structure milk eggs feathers
as early as eighteen ninety two mister parkinson thought of improving the output by recovering the cold produced by liquid air during its evaporation but an incorrect idea which seems to have resulted from certain experiments of dewar the idea that the phenomenon
no notice is taken of the fact that at the moment of the shock their centres of gravity are still separated by a distance equal to twice the radius of the molecule
solid alloys may be classed like liquid ones two metals or more dissolve one into the other and form a solid solution quite analogous to the liquid solution but the study of these solid solutions is rendered singularly difficult by the fact that the equilibrium so rapidly reached in the case of liquids in this case takes days
he has managed to measure with precision pressures amounting to three thousand atmospheres and also the very small volumes then occupied by the fluid mass under consideration this last measurement which necessitates numerous corrections is the most delicate part of the operation
in which we examine the relations existing between the pressure the volume and the temperature of bodies and in which are comprised under the term fluid gases as well as liquids
in this theory the representative system is considered dependent on the temperature of one of several other variables such as for example a chemical variable a similar idea has been developed in a very fine set of memoirs on nickel steel by monsieur charles edouard guillaume
the course of his researches monsieur tamman has been led to certain very important observations and has met with fresh allotropic modifications in nearly all substances which singularly complicate the question
liquid faction of air would not be owing to certain peculiarities the exact converse of that of vaporization led to the employment of very imperfect apparatus monsieur claude however by making use of a method which he calls the reversal method
in the same way magnetic properties have been studied a very interesting result is that found in oxygen the magnetic susceptibility of this body increases at the moment of liquefaction nevertheless this increase which is enormous
the eminent physicist who by his earlier researches has greatly contributed to the light thrown on the analogous question of the displacement of the zero in thermometers concludes from fresh researches that the residual phenomena are due to chemical variations
this is necessary to add to them some other specific parameters m mathias and m d berthelot have indicated some which seem to play a considerable part it results also from this that the characteristic equation of a fluid cannot yet be considered perfectly known
to get at this we neglect two important factors we do not take into account in fact the attraction which the molecules must exercise on each other now this attraction which is never absolutely non-existent may become considerable when the molecules are drawn closer together that is to say
chemical affinity is almost put an end to phosphorus and potassium remain inert in liquid oxygen it should however be noted and this remark has doubtless some interest for the theories of photographic action that photographic substances remain even at the temperature of liquid hydrogen
neither the equation of van der waals nor the more complicated formulas which have been proposed by various authors are in perfect conformity with reality we may think that researches of this kind will only be successful if attention is concentrated not only on the phenomena of compressibility and dilation but also on the calorimetric properties of bodies
the mechanical properties of bodies also undergo important modifications in general their cohesion is greatly increased and the dilation produced by slight changes of temperature is considerable
among the discoveries made with the new processes the one which most strikingly interests public attention is that of new gases in the atmosphere we know how sir william ramsay and dr travers first observed by means of the spectroscope characteristic of the companions of argon in the least volatile part of the atmosphere
the philosophical importance and the practical interest of the discovery nevertheless remain considerable as was to be expected numbers of experimenters have sought whether these consequences are duly verified in reality
but it seems hardly possible to consider the case of crystal in which molecular movements must be essentially regular as a natural sequence to the case of the liquid which we are on the contrary in the presence of an extremely disordered state of movement
everything leads to the belief that they show the existence on the earth of an earlier state of things now vanished it may be supposed for instance that helium and neon of which the molecular mass is very slight were formerly more abundant on our planet but an epoch when the temperature of the globe was higher
we must necessarily conclude that there is a discontinuity which nothing can remove the distinction established from the point of view of daily custom between solids and liquids proceeds especially from the difficulty that we meet within the one case
the optical examination of the first-named bodies is very difficult because appearances may be produced which are due to the phenomena of refraction and imitate those of polarization for the other kind which are often as mobile as water the fact that they polarize light is absolutely unquestionable
when the compressed gaseous mass occupies a more and more restricted volume on the other hand we assimilate the molecules as a first approximation to material points without dimensions in the evaluation of the path traversed by each molecule
in the course of studies conducted with rare success and remarkable ingenuity may render great services because it is possible to regulate so to speak at will their mechanical or magnetic properties
all along the curve of transformation the two states may exist in equilibrium but we may assert that it is impossible to realize a continuous series of intermediaries between these two states there will always be a more or less marked discontinuity in some of the properties
this the phenomenon of retrograde condensation we may say that the properties of the critical point of a homogeneous substance are in a way divided when it is a question of a binary mixture between the two points mentioned
section four the deformations of solids if the mechanical properties of the bodies intermediate between solids and liquids have only lately been the object of systematic studies
has furnished the most valuable information on all the laws of compressibility and dilatation the classical work of andrews was not very wide andrews did not go much beyond pressures close to the normal and ordinary temperatures of late years several very interesting and peculiar cases have been examined by mm cailletet
there is then a solution of continuity of the various properties of the substance and the two phases may co-exist we might presume also by analogy with what happens with liquids and gases that if we followed the curve of transformation of the crystalline into the liquid phase
if the isothermal diagrams of two substances be drawn to the same scale taking as unit of volume and of pressure the values of the critical constants the two diagrams should coincide that is to say their superposition should present the aspect of one diagram appertaining to a single substance
this figure exact within a few billions proves that the rigidity is very slight but exists and that suffices a characteristic distinction to be found on this property
an important conclusion has been drawn from these experiments which affects cosmogonical theories since the cold of space could not kill the germs of life it is in no way absurd to suppose that under proper conditions a germ may be transmitted from one planet to another
this space is comprised between two extreme temperatures the lower corresponding to what is called the folding point the higher to that which we call the point of contact of the mixture between these two temperatures an isothermal compression yields a quantity of liquid which increases then reaches a maximum diminishes and disappears
these modifications which may be called phenomena of the hysteresis of dilation may be followed in very appreciable fashions by means of a glass thermometer the general results are quite in accord with the previsions of m duhem m lenoble in researches on the traction of metallic wires and m chevalier in experiments
the skill shown by m bouasse authorises us to hope that thanks to his researches a strong light will some day illumine these unknown corners a particularly interesting chapter on elasticity is that relating to the study of crystals
m amagat particularly has made use for this purpose of a most original and simple method he remarks that in all its generality the law may be translated thus
we are a little less advanced as regards abnormal substances that is to say those composed of molecules partly simple and partly complex and either dissociated or associated
because they have not yet completely lost their peculiar structure yet the transition is not necessarily established in a continuous fashion when we are dealing with the passage of one the same determinate substance from the liquid to the solid form we conceive that this change may take place by insensible degrees in the case of an amorphous body
observed various experimenters have endeavoured of recent years to elucidate this question it cannot be considered absolutely settled but these very curious experiments pursued with great patience and remarkable ingenuity allow us to think that there really exist certain intermediary forms
results perhaps more precise may also be obtained if one keeps to two constants or even to a single one temperature for example by employing various special methods many others monsieur callatay  and colardeau monsieur young monsieur
we at once demonstrate that the gas ought to obey the laws of mariotte and of gay-lussac so that the characteristic equation would be obtained by the statement that the product of the number which is the measure of the volume by that which is the measure of the pressure is equal to a constant coefficient multiplied by the degree of the absolute temperature
his researches have in fact proved that the pressure of air congealed by liquid hydrogen cannot exceed the millionth of an atmosphere we have then in this process an original and rapid means of creating an excellent vacuum in apparatus of very different kind a means which in certain cases may be particularly convenient
for it does not trouble itself about the nature of the bodies obedient to its laws but on the other hand it intervenes to determine the properties of coexisting phases if we examine the conditions of equilibrium of a mixture which is not subjected to external forces it will be demonstrated that the distribution must come back to a juxtaposition of homogeneous phases
the three critical constants may be determined as mr s young and m amagat have shown by a direct method based on the consideration of the saturated states
and that the return to the primary chemical state causes the variation to disappear he applies his idea not only to the phenomena represented by irreversible steels but also to very different facts for example to phosphorescence certain particularities of which may be interpreted in an analogous manner
the calculation thus pursued leads to our adding to the pressure in the simple equation a term which is designated to the internal pressure and which is the quotient of a constant by the square of the volume
monsieur tamman has demonstrated that amorphous solids may very well in fact be regarded as superposed liquids endowed with very great viscosity but it is no longer the same thing when the solid is once in the crystallized state
one which is entirely arbitrary namely that when the state of the system is given external action capable of maintaining it in that state are determined without ambiguity
when flowers become phosphorescent the same is the case with certain simple bodies such as oxygen which is transformed into ozone and emits a white light in the process
sir james dewar on the one hand and sir william ramsay on the other subsequently separated in addition to argon and helium crypton xenon and neon the process employed consists essentially in first solidifying the least volatile part of the air and then causing it to evaporate with extreme slowness
krypton neon which have density four times greater than oxygen may on the contrary have partly disappeared by solution at the bottom of the sea where it is not absurd to suppose that considerable quantities would be found liquefied at great depths
and the facility in the other when we wish to change their forms temporarily or permanently by the action of mechanical force this distinction only corresponds however in reality to a difference in the value of certain coefficients it is impossible to discover by this means any absolute characteristic which establishes a separation between the two classes
all these facts have been admirably set forth and systematically coordinated by m mathias who by his own researches moreover has made contributions of the highest value to the study of questions regarding the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states
these researches deserve attention by their interest and the generality of the results to which they have led they also give a remarkable example of the happy effects which may be obtained by the combined employment of the various methods of investigation used in exploring the domain of nature
phosphorescent organisms cease it is true to shine at the temperature of liquid air but this fact is simply due to the oxidations and other chemical reactions which keep up the phosphorescence being then suspended for phosphorescent activity reappears as so soon as the temperature is again sufficiently raised
i am unable to enter here into the detail of the questions connected with the theory of gibbs which have been the object of numerous theoretical studies and also of a series ever more and more abundant of experimental researches m duhem in particular has published on the subject memoirs of the highest importance and a great number of experimenters
alloys are generally known in the two states of solid and liquid fused alloys consist of one or several solutions of the component metals and of a certain number of definite combinations
thermodynamics has in fact allowed us to obtain numerical relations between the various coefficients and atomic hypotheses have led to the establishment of one capital relation the characteristic equation of fluids while on the other hand experiment in which the progress made in the art of measurement has been utilized
and to determine the value of the various coefficients as well as their variations it ought to be possible to condense all these results into a single formula representing the volume the temperature and the pressure rankin and subsequently recknagel and then hirn formerly proposed formulas of that kind
in a given volume matter ought so to arrange itself that the total sum of free energy has a minimum value thus in order to elucidate all questions relating to the number and qualities of the phases into which the substance divides itself we are led to regard the geometrical surface which for a given temperature represents the free energy
but the most famous the one which first appeared to contain in a satisfactory manner all the facts which experiments brought to light and led to the production of many others was the celebrated equation of van der waals
and by the measurement of the resistivities of the densities and the differences of potential or contact the most valuable indications as to their constitution are obtained
even if they present themselves in different degrees that by a continuous series of intermediary bodies the two classes might yet be connected if on the other hand we discover that there exists in these two classes some quality of a different nature
we see by this example that admirable as is the progress accomplished in certain regions of physics there still exist many over neglected regions which remain in painful darkness
various verifications of this formula have been effected and it has in particular been the object of very important remarks by monsieur daniel berthelot it is interesting to note that thermodynamics seems powerless to determine this equation
unfortunately all those liquids are turbid and it may be objected that they are not homogeneous this want of homogeneity according to monsieur quincke be due to the existence of particles suspended in a liquid in contact with another miscible with it
these researches have dealt with a certain number of different bodies those relating to carbonic acid and ethylene take in the critical point others on hydrogen and nitrogen for instance are very extended
the knowledge of this torsion the rigidity can be deduced in the case of a solution containing half a percent of gelatin it is found that this rigidity enormous compared with that of water is still however one trillion eight hundred and forty billion times less than that of steel
the further knowledge of critical elements has allowed the laws of corresponding states to be more closely examined in the case of homogeneous substances it has shown that as i have already said bodies must be arranged in groups and this fact clearly proves that the properties of a given fluid are not determined by its critical constants alone
look you here i want a wife and i'll marry your daughter but look you here says he eleven months out of the year she shall have all the vittles she likes to eat and all the gowns she likes to get and all the company she likes to have but the last month of the year she'll have to spin five skeins every day and if she don't
the good humoured sabina however got up filled the bucket and was rewarded by a handful of silver pennies found in it the next morning but long ere that time had arrived what was her alarm as she crept towards the bed to hear all the elves buzzing like so many angry bees
and withal he heard such music and he thought that orpheus that famous greek fiddler had he been alive compared to one of these had been but a poor musician
nimmy nimmy not yar name's tom tit tot well when that heard her that shrieked awful and away that flew into the dark and she never saw it no more
and to the surprise of all there appeared not a frightful wild beast but one of the most beautiful princes ever beheld you may believe how delighted the princess was to see him fall at her feet and thank her for breaking his cruel enchantment
well come supper-time the woman she said go you and git one o them there pies i dare say they've come again now the gal she went an she looked but there weren't nothing but the dishes so back she came and says she no that ain't come again
except that molly was to go lame on her right leg for seven long years unless an herb with a strange name could be got to cure her and lame molly went for nearly the whole of those seven years
in the morning the old wifie gave her three nuts and she was not to break until her heart was like to break and o'er again like to break so showing her the way she bade god speed her and the princess once more sat out on her wearisome journey
no that ain't says he and he twirled his tail harder and away he flew well when her husband he come in there was the five skeins ready for him
you and bring the best of 'em best or worst says the gal i ate 'em all and you can't ha' one till that's come again well the woman she were wholly bate and she took her spinnin' to the door to spin and as she span she sang
so much for the birth and christening of little robin when robin was grown to six years of age he was so knavish that all the neighbours did complain of him for no sooner was his mother's back turned but he was in one knavish action or other so that his mother was constrained to avoid the complaints
which was to plague her for seven years and was only to be cured by a certain herb growing on dartmoor its long and learned and very queer and difficult name
at length she dropped asleep and did not wake until the morning now whether sabina's head was like a sieve that lets out as fast as it takes in or if the overexertion to remember only caused her to forget cannot be determined but certain it is that when she opened her eyes she knew nothing at all about the matter
mother says she put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em there a little and they'll come again she meant you know the crust would get soft but the gal she says to herself well if they'll come again i'll ate em now and she set to work and ate em all first and last
no sooner did he ride into the very middle of the pond than robin goodfellow turned himself into a fish and so left him with nothing but the pack saddle on which he was riding betwixt his legs meanwhile the fish swiftly swam to the bank and then robin changed to a naughty boy again ran away laughing ha ha
and leapt and curveted as nimbly as if he had been in stable at rack and manger a full month then he wished himself a black dog and he was so then a green tree and he was so so from one thing to another till he was quite sure that he could change himself to anything whatsoever he liked
a thing answered the clown that shows the time of day why then said robin goodfellow be thou a clock and tell me what time of the day it is
these shrewd answers vexed robin goodfellow so that in himself he vowed to be revenged of the clown which he did in this manner robin goodfellow turned himself into a bird and followed this fellow who was going into a field a little from that place to catch a horse that was at grass
well she felt that horrid howsomeover she heard the king a-comin along the passage in he came an when he see the five skeins he says says he
duke of norway will ye no turn and speak to me though she sang this over and over again the duke never wakened and in the morning the princess had to leave him without his knowing she had ever been there
from that very moment she got well and lame molly became the best dancer in the whole town when she and sabina danced at the feast of mayday on the green
once upon a time a great while ago when men did eat and drink less and were more honest and knew no knavery there was wont to walk many harmless spirits called fairies dancing in brave orders in fairy rings on green hills with sweet music
the princess happy to be the means of breaking his second evil spell consented to marry him and the wicked witch-wife who fled that country afraid of the duke's anger has never since been heard of
once however it was forgotten and the pixies finding themselves disappointed by an empty bucket whisked upstairs to the maid's bedroom popped through the keyhole and began to exclaim aloud against the laziness and neglect of the damsels
and with many endearing expressions of surprise and joy explained to her that he had long been in the power of a witch-wife whose spells over him were now happily ended by their once again meeting
which they would leave for them sometimes in their shoes other times in their pockets sometimes in bright basins and other clean vessels now it chanced that in those happy days a babe was born in a house to which the fairies did like well to repair
what's your pay says she that looked out with the corner of that's eyes and that said i'll give you three guesses every night to guess my name and if you hain't guessed it afore the month's up you shall be mine
she began to think about them there skeins and to wonder if he had them in mind but not one word did he say about them an she wholly thought he'd forgot them but the last day o the last month he takes her to a room she'd never sets eyes on afore
the princess from being filled with happiness was all but broken-hearted she determined however to seek through all the world for him and many weary ways she went but for a long long while nothing could she hear of her lover
but then again he stood still and let the clown mount him once more by the way which the clown now would ride was a great pond of water of a good depth which covered the road
well the next day the king he took her into the room and there was that the flax and the day's vittles now there's the flax says he and if it ain't spun up this night off goes your head and then he went out and locked the door
i will give it to you said she only on condition that you put off for one day your marriage with the duke of norway and that i may go into his room alone tonight so
this pipe was so shrill and so sweet that a scottish pipe compared to it it would no more come near it than a jew's-harp doth to an irish harp after they had danced king oberon said to robin
he held in his hand a green herb with a tiny yellow flower which some say was called inula helenium and he insisted upon striking molly with it on the lame leg
whene'er you hear the piper blow round and round the fairies go and nightly you must with us dance in meadows where the moonbeams glance and make the circle hand in hand that is the law of fairyland where thou shalt see what no man knows while sleep the eyes of men doth close
take time woman that says next guess and you're mine and that stretched out that's black hands at her well she backed a step or two and she looked at it and then she laughed out and says she a pointing of her finger at it
well she thought she'd sure be to guess that's name afore the month was up all right she says i agree all right that says an look how that twirled that's tail
the horse being wild ran over dyke and hedge and the fellow after but to little purpose for the horse was too swift for him robin was glad for this occasion for now or never was the time to have his revenge
one talked of sending her the toothache another of giving her a red nose but this last was voted much too bad a punishment for a pretty young lass so tempering mercy with justice the pixies were kind enough to let her off with a lame leg
all was hurry and preparation in the castle and the marriage which took place happily ended the adventures of the black bull o' norroway and the wanderings of the king's daughter
presently robin shaped himself exactly like the horse that the clown followed and so stood right before him then the clown took hold of the horse's mane and got on his back but he had not ridden far when with a stumble robin hurled his rider over his head so that he almost broke his neck
so marched they with their piper before to the fairy land there did king oberon show robin goodfellow many secrets which he never did open to the world and there in fairy land doth robin goodfellow abide now this many a long year
there weren't nothing in it but a spinning wheel and a stool and says he no my dear here you'll be shut in tomorrow with some vittles and some flax and if you ain't spun five skeins by the night your head will go off an away he went about his business
i owe thee not so much service answered the clown again but because thou shalt think thyself beholden to me know that it is the same time of the day as it was yesterday at this time
the pixy flower once upon a time there lived in devonshire two serving damsels called molly and sabina who were very fond of ribands and finery
there were great rejoicings in the castle at this but alas in the midst of them he suddenly disappeared and though every place was sought he was nowhere to be found
when their mistress scolded them for spending more money than they ought upon such things they said the pixies were very kind to them and would often drop silver for their pleasure into a bucket of fair water which they placed for the accommodation of those little beings in the chimney corner every night before they went to bed
after robin had travelled a good day's journey from his mother's house he sat down and being weary he fell asleep no sooner had slumber closed his eye-lids but he thought he saw many goodly proper little personages in antic measures tripping about him
then sent they one by one all the servants then the two eldest princesses but not one of them met with any better treatment than the old henwife and at last they were forced to send their youngest and favourite child
do thus and all the world shall know the pranks of robin goodfellow for by that name thou shall called be to age's last posterity and if thou keep my just command one day thou shall see fairy land
oberon took robin by the hand and led him in a fair dance their musician had an excellent bagpipe made of a wren's quill and the skin of a greenland fly
thou hast the power to change thy shape to horse to hog to dog to ape transformed thus by any means see none thou harmst but knaves and queens but love thou those that honest be and help them in necessity
then wished he for plum-pudding he straightway had it this liked him well and because he was weary he wished himself a horse no sooner was his wish ended but he was changed into as fine a nag as you need see
robin having read this was very joyful yet longed he to know whether he had the power or not and to try it he wished for some meat presently a fine dish of roast veal was before him
traveling once through a dark wood she lost her way and as night was coming on she thought she must now certainly die of cold and hunger but seeing a light through the trees she went on till she came to a little hut where an old woman lived who took her in and gave her both food and shelter
not none on 'em says the mother not none on 'em says she well come again or not come again says the woman i'll have one for supper but you can't if they ain't come says the gal but i can says she good
as delights commonly last not long so did those end sooner than robin would willingly they should have done and for very grief he awakened and found by him lying a scroll wherein was written these lines following in golden letters
ah t'ain't that neither that says then that looks at her with that's eyes like a coal of fire and that says woman there's only tomorrow night and then you'll be mine and away it flew
the princess then went into the castle and asked to see the lady who no sooner saw the wee wifey so hard at work than she offered the princess anything in her castle for it
i shall kill her all right says the woman for she thought what a grand marriage that was and as for them five skeins when it came to time there'd be plenty o' ways to getting out of it and likeliest he'd have forgotten about it
so i got off my hobby and i went right quiet to the pit and i looked down well what should there be but the funniest little black thing you ever set eyes on and what was that a-doin on but that had a little spinning wheel and that were a spinning wonderful fast and a twirling that tail
he'd hardly gone when there was a knocking on the window she upped and she oped it and there sure enough was the little old thing a setting on the ledge where's the flax says he here it be says she and she gonned it to him
she said it over and over again tied a knot in her garter at every syllable as a help to memory and thought she had the word just as safe and sure as her own name and very possibly felt much more anxious about retaining the one than the other
the lord of the castle pressed them to stay though much he wondered at the lovely princess and her strange companion but as they went in among the guests the princess espied a pin sticking in the black bull's hide which she pulled out
what is that bill says she noo that ain't says he an he twirled his tail is that ned says she noo that ain't says he an he twirled his tail well is that mark says she
next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for the flax and when night came she heard that a knockin' on the window panes she oped the window and that come right in on the ledge that were grinnin' from ear to ear an ooh that's tail were twirlin' round so fast
what were that you was a-singing of maw'r the woman she were ashamed to let him hear what her darter had been a-doin so she sang stids o that my darter ha spun five
well in the evening a knockin' came again to the window she upped and she oped it and there were the little old thing with five skeins of flax on his arm here to be says he and he gonned it to her now what's my name says he
and the pride not only of her father and mother but of all in the land as it fell out the three princesses were talking one night of whom they would marry i would have no one lower than a king said the eldest princess the second would take a prince or a great duke even ha
that says is that samble says she no it ain't that says a-well is it methusalem says she no
robin my only son and heir how to live take thou no care by nature thou hast cunning shifts which i'll increase with other gifts wish what thou wilt thou shall it have and for to fetch both fool and knave
at length about the end of that time sabina and molly went out into the fields early one morning to pick mushrooms when a merry squint-eyed queer-looking boy started up all of a sudden just as molly went to pluck a fine big one and came tumbling head over heels towards her
when as they sat at breakfast they heard the most dreadful bellowing at the door and what should it be but the black bull come for his bride you may be sure they were all terribly frightened at this for the black bull was one of the most horrible creatures ever seen in the world
to take him with her to market or wheresoever she went or rode but this helped little or nothing for if he rode before her then he would make mouths and ill favored faces at those he met if he rode behind her then would he clap his hand on the tail so that his mother was weary of the many complaints that came against him
ha said the youngest laughing you both are so proud now i would be content with the black bull o norroway well they thought no more of the matter till the next morning
at last she came to a castle where nothing was to be seen but cooks and bakers some running one way and some another and all so busy that they did not know what to do first while she was looking at this she heard a noise of hunters behind her and someone cried out make way for the duke of norway
and who should ride past but the prince and a beautiful lady you may be sure her heart was now like to break and over again like to break and at this sad sight so she broke one of the nuts and out came a wee wife carting wool
now sabina who lay awake and heard all this jogged her fellow-servant and proposed getting up immediately to put things straight but molly lazy girl who liked not being disturbed out of a comfortable nap pettishly declared that for her part she would not stir out of bed to please all the pixies in devonshire
that won't do no harm if that don't do no good and she upped and told about the pies and the skeins and everything this is what i'll do says the little black thing i'll come to your window every morning and take the flax and bring it spun at night
yet knew she not how to beat him justly for it because she never saw him do that which was worthy blows the complaints were daily so renewed that his mother promised him a whipping robin did not like that cheer and therefore to avoid it he ran away and left his mother a-sorrowing for him
and all the day the mother she set a-trying for to think of names to say to it when it come at night but she never hit on the right one and as it got toward the end of the month the impet that began for to look so maliceful and that twirled that's tail faster and faster each time she gave a guess
and cockleshell with sweet brier and bonfire and strawberry wine and columbine and when he had sung this over he fell to wondering what he should next turn himself into
this babe was a boy and the fairies to show their pleasure brought many pretty things thither coverlets and delicate linen for his cradle and capons woodcock and quail for the christening at which there was so much good cheer that the clerk had almost forgot to say the babe's name robin goodfellow
far she travelled upon the black bull through many dreadful forests and lowly wastes till they came at last to a noble castle where a large company was assembled
the elfin judge pronounced in a high and shrill voice it was a name of seven syllables seven being also the number of years decreed for molly's lameness sabina good-natured maid wish to save her fellow damsel so long a suffering tried with might and main to bear in mind the name of the strange herb
i see i shan't have for to kill you tonight my dear says he you'll have your vittles and your flax in the morning says he and away he goes well every day the flax and the vittles they was brought and every day that there little black impet used for to come to mornings and evenings
robin hearing this rose and went to him there were with king oberon many fairies all attired in green all these with king oberon did welcome robin goodfellow into their company
and as that span that sang nimmy nimmy not my name's tom tit tot well when the mother heard this she feared as if she could have jumped out of her skin for joy but she didn't say a word
thereupon full of delight at his new powers robin goodfellow set out eager to put them to the test as he was crossing a field he met with a red-faced carter's clown and called to him to stop friend quoth he what is a clock
sometimes they were invisible and sometimes took diverse shapes many mad pranks would they play as pinching of untidy damsels black and blue and misplacing things in ill-ordered houses but lovingly would they use good girls giving them silver and other pretty toys
and consulting as to what should be done to the lazy lazy lass who would not stir out of bed for their pleasure some proposed pinches nips and bobs others wanted to spoil her new cherry coloured bonnet and ribbons
and the king and queen did not know how to save their daughter at last they determined to send him off with the old henwife so they put her on his back and away he went with her till he came to a great black forest when throwing her down he returned roaring louder and more frightfully than ever
shortly thereafter flynn sent a text message to mcfarland summarizing his call with kislyak from the day before which she emailed to kushner bannon priebus and other transition team members

prince also believed he provided bannon with dmitriev's contact information according to prince bannon instructed prince not to follow up with dmitriev and prince had the impression that the issue was not a priority for bannon prince related that bannon did not appear angry just relatively uninterested
the investigation did not identify evidence of flynn or kushner meeting with ushakov after being given his name in the meantime although he had already formed the impression that kislyak was not necessarily the right point of contact

and the second is to know how to do it he looked out of the window in a wholly impersonal way but his words had a more personal slant than he would have given them at almost any other time
good all through and kind of capable that is he was a worth a salary of for eighteen hundred a year or two thousand he married a girl worth two thousand a month
mcdowell contracted his eyes to a critical narrowness you may not be singing much longer for anything else either that's another matter it isn't you that put the choir together
um no he said in a offhand way too near the lake fog damp rheumatism and pneumonia too perhaps his wife suggested feebly
i don't sing for glory he had declared with an offensive brusqueness it's the here and not the hereafter that i'm busy with mcdowell looked at him uneasily
mcdowell did some figuring and saw some people and somewhat later vibert returned he threw his check on mcdowell's desk contemptuously that's no good
he withdrew after some further parleyings in a confused and inconclusive state of mind well convinced however of mcdowell's abilities and more fully conscious of mcdowell's position as the husband of his father's daughter
society was present in the shape of a young couple who were called mr and mrs valentine the elder daughter received him with a quiet and simple cordiality he could not help looking about furtively for the possible presence of the younger

so attached murmured her mother vaguely mrs valentine continued for some time further to flutter her hands her clothing and her conversation but she was very slow about getting up and fluttering away

evoke thirty in reply he met george's belief and modest suggestions with a hitching of his shoulders and answered them in a harsh and strident tone

besides mrs ogden with a multitude of a small experiences had no ability for grasping things in a large and general way while george with a broader and more comprehensive outlook was embarrassed by a lack of experience in the actual details of a business transactions
hitherto the financial arrangements of the church had gone on with the same precision as its anthems and its processionals in the present condition of things delay to vibert was more than a surprise more than an embarrassment it was an exasperation
i guess he is just about as hard as any man ever was but he has fought through gallantly i say that for him what's his story
ogden sighed unconsciously he had fancied the first ray of social illumination as falling upon this benighted family but it was only the last faint glow of a speeding twilight after all
he went up to mcdowell's office in the later part of the afternoon as he entered a tall dark man was standing in the middle of the room there was a sinister look in his eyes and a contemptuously sarcastic smile on his heavy red lips
there was a light burning in it and the fireplace showed the faint red of the dying coals a valise open and half unpacked stood in the middle of the floor and sitting up in the bed was brower busy with the last volume of monte cristo

brower gave a second hitch to the pillow and threw the book to the foot of the bed he's another he's had a trip in the same boat why he isn't married
he had not remained ignorant of her half hour wait in a cab outside the bank but he might have surmised the inflexibility of her father's will

the thousands of acres of ramshackle that made up the bulk of the city and the tens of thousands of raw and ugly and half-built prairie that composed its environs seemed together to constitute a great checker-board over whose squares of section
george looked at him studiously he appeared to be in a state of extreme nervous irritation his wiry moustache moved up and down stiffly as he felt about with
god knows i've got enough to do already but kittie's affairs are mine she has equal interests with the others and she seems to feel that i am able and willing to look after them
he presently took upon himself the delicate task of intimating to mcdowell that a simpler and more regular way of doing things was desired
and this was the most that he permitted himself but mcdowell was in the sensitive state of mind when one word does the work of three and in the irritable state of mind when talk is such a relief that three words
he saw he had got to strike society and he struck it hard he costs like smoke but he snatched victory from defeat it was a great act speaking of act who do you think i saw there in the stage box tonight who
my private life is nobody's business i say i'm worth the money that may work on the stage it won't work quite so close to the pulpit
i believe we are satisfied where we are fanny she said in a low and even tone we have always lived here we feel more at home in this house than we could anywhere else
the old man had refused to see her or to let her see him the most that he would yield was a species of non-committal communication through burt

added to this he was a newcomer under all newcomer's disadvantages he hardly knew where to turn for the proper agents legal or financial that might have been employed
come now i know a little something about your daily doings plenty of men sing who don't hang around race-tracks and loaves in pool-rooms and from what i hear you're helping that young brainard along at a good gait too you'd better wait along with the others

certainly he had come to view with more interest a girl whose hand had lain in his and whose head had rested on his shoulder there had been no embarrassment in her greeting of him
his teeth for the inner membrane of his lips his long lean fingers were interlaced and a clicking sound came from his snapping his fingernails together it was clearly no occasion for more than a partial statement of ogden's matter
mcdowell's elbow rested on the edge of his desk his thumb on the tip of his ear and his middle finger rubbing his farther eyebrow as he looked out steadily on vibert from under his hand

the capacity experience and accumulation of a man over thirty-five or forty he regarded every intruder in the light of a potential son-in-law and no more potential than undesirable
her husband in fact had fallen upon her crushed her absorbed her as a heavy blotting-pad falls on a page of light and delicate writing except for one thing she had no aim no occupation no diversion beyond her ills and remedies
this turned out to be the case it was as great a tribute as the family ordinarily paid to society the family he found represented by brainard his wife and his elder daughter

i thought it best to have him to dinner once or twice and i'm glad i did hes been so interested all through there hasn't been the least hitch to speak of and i expect to get in within a fortnight this she went on turning to ogden with an undiminished vivacity

the brainard house reared itself in the same frivolous ugliness that we have already viewed but an excess of light came through the front parlor windows and ogden was prepared to find that at least four of the eight burners in the big chandeliers were lighted
poor fellow he deserves a better fate what's the matter with him his wife owns him george smiled brower hitched himself on his pillow and put his finger into the book to keep the place he was a first-rate fellow

poor love said life that hast nor gold nor lands nor other store i ween thy very shelter from the cold is oft but lowly built and mean
nay though of rushes be my bed yet i am rich love said but argued life thrice fond art thou to yield the sovereign gifts of earth the victor sword the laureled brow for visioned things of little worth
because they did not keep the white brachet at home so it has come to pass that a number of times we have sought to destroy the hound so that my brother and his lady
oh my white heart art thou then dead and wherewith she fell to weeping with great passion and then sir gawaine said
and clad himself in his armor and in a little while he came out very fiercely sir said sir gawaine what is thy quarrel with me and the lord of the castle said
in such wise would be dishonored for aye and i cannot think that anyone who would strike a lady in that wise would hold himself guiltless unto his vow of knighthood
when it behooved him to do them for haply ye who have read this story may feel as queen guinevere did that sir gawaine was not rightwise courteous as a belted knight should have been in that adventure aforetold
and by and by the white hart that belonged to my lady came fleeing through the woodland and the white brachet that belonged to my brother's lady was in pursuit of it and my brother and his lady and two esquires followed rapidly after the hart and the brachet
lady i'm very sorry for what i have done and i would that i could undo it then the lord of the castle said to sir gawaine sir
well quoth sir gawaine since now both the hart and the hound are dead ye can assuredly bear no more enmity toward her and your brother wherefore i do beseech you that you will let her go free and will enter again into a condition of amity and goodwill the one with the other
attached to a golden collar that encircled its neck and the white hart she gave unto my lady and the white brachet she gave unto my lady's sister and then she went away leaving them very glad but their gladness did not last for very long
lying beside the road like any carrion and they saw that the hound was pierced through with three arrows wherefore they wist that it had been slain very violently now when sir gawaine beheld that beautiful hound lying dead in that wise he was filled with great sorrow
and the lady was extraordinarily graceful and very beautiful of appearance sir gawaine looked upon the lady and he thought he had hardly ever seen so beautiful a dame
he could not contain himself for joy therewith sir gawaine came to him and lifted him up from the ground where he was and kissed him upon the cheek then certain others came and bare the lady away into her chamber
and the next day sir gawaine and his brother gaheris returned unto this court of the king and he told king arthur and his court all that had befallen hiding nothing from them
now queen guinevere was very much displeased when she heard how sir gawaine show no mercy to that knight and how he had struck the lady with his sword wherefore she said aside to one of those who stood nigh to her
but sir gawaine was very furious with anger because of the unexpected blow which he had received and because of the great agony of the wound wherefore he could not have mercy but lifted up his sword with intent to slay that knight
have held equal offence against us now this day it chanced i was toward the outskirts of the forest to the east of us when i heard a great outcry in the woodland
this is a very strange matter now i beseech thee to tell me of what appearance was the lady who gave the white hart and the white hound unto those two ladies
then sir gawaine catched his helmet and rushed it off from his head upon this the knight said in a weak voice sir knight i crave mercy of you and yield myself to you
which led me into this adventure to this the lord of the castle whose name was sir ablamor of the marise said i will do so and therewith he spake as follows you must know sir that i have a brother who hath always been very dear to me
and unto the bone of the shoulder so that sir gawaine was put to a great agony of pain at the stroke then sir gawaine was filled with rage at the pain of the wound wherefore he smote the knight so woeful a blow
so he took the sword out of its sheath and break it across his knee and flung it away now all this hath been told to set forth that which follows for there ye shall learn what great things of nobility sir gawaine could do
for i do not think that either my lady or her sister ever beheld her like before this strange lady brought unto those two ladies a white hart and a white brachet and the hart and the hound she held each by a silver chain
and could not stay his blow nevertheless he was able to turn his sword in his hand so that the edge thereof did not smite the lady but the flat of the sword struck her upon the neck a very grievous blow and the blade cut her a little
didst thou slay that stag yea said sir gawaine sir said the lord of the castle thou hast done very ill in this matter and if thou wilt
and there in mine anger i struck my brother a great blow so that i smote him down from his horse and i catched his lady and i threw her across the horn of my saddle
and when i took this my lady unto wife he took her sister as his wife now my brother dwelt in a castle nigh to this and we held commerce together in great amity but it befell upon a day that my lady and my brother's lady
forever since that time there hath been nothing else but discord between my brother and myself and between my lady and her sister for the white hound hath ever sought the white hart for to destroy it wherefore i and my lady have entertained very great offense against my brother and his lady
now as soon as the white hart beheld those two strangers it fled with great speed toward the castle and it ran into the courtyard of the castle and when sir gawaine beheld the stag he gave chase in pursuit of it with great speed
wherefore he was more sorry than ever that in his haste he had slain that white hart but when the lady of the castle beheld the white hart that it lay dead upon the stone pavement of the courtyard
but by now the damsels of the lady had come to her where she lay and the chiefest of these cried out to the lord of the castle ha sir thy lady is not dead but only in a swoon from which she will presently recover
but tell me messire where now is that lady thy wife's sister sir said the knight she's in the castle and is a prisoner of honor
upon this the lord of the castle was more wroth than ever and he ran at sir gawaine and smote him unawares so that he cleave through the epaulier of his armor and cut through the flesh
so the knight said that he would do that and thereupon they parted the one party going the one way and the other party going the other way
it seems to me a very strange thing for a belted knight to do to refuse to give mercy unto a fallen enemy and to strike a lady with his sword for i should think that any sword that had drawn blood from a lady
and the shame of it is mine also because thou art my brother now i wish i had not come with thee to this place then sir gawaine said to the lord of that castle
that he cut through his helmet and into the bone beneath and thereupon the knight fell down upon his knees because of the fierceness of the blow and he could not rise up again
because of that white hart which it pursued now i make my vow that if i can find that hart i will slay it with mine own hands because it was in that chase that this hound met its death
i will not now have thy mercy for thou art a knight without mercy and without pity and since thou hast slain my lady who is dearer to me than my life thou mayst slay me also for that is the only service which thou canst now render me
what a pity it is he cried that this noble hound should be slain in this wise for i think that it was the most beautiful hound that ever i saw in all my life here hath assuredly been great treachery against it for it hath been fully dealt with
after that they rode forward toward the castle and as they drew nigh lo they beheld that white hart with the golden collar browsing upon the meadows before the castle
and he was all a dread at what he had done wherefore he cried woe is me what have i done alas said gaheris that was a very shameful blow that thou didst strike
so that the blood ran over her smooth white neck and over her kerchief and with the violence of the blow the lady fell down and lay upon the ground as though she were dead now when sir gawaine beheld that he thought that he had slain that lady in his haste
now with all this tumult there came out the lord and the lady of the castle and the lord was one very haughty and noble aspect
for now she spendeth all of her time in doing such mischief as this by means of her enchantment out of pure despite and indeed i think it would be a very good thing if she were put out of this world so that she could do no more such mischief
then the lady of the castle beheld what sir gawaine was intent to do and she brake away from her damsels and ran and flung herself upon the knight so as to shield him with her own body and in that moment sir gawaine was striking
but some time i will show to her that i have in me more courtesy and i am more gentle that she believes me to be as for my sword since she deemeth to be dishonored by that blow i will not use it anymore
and there in a little while she recovered from that swoon and was but little the worse for the blow she had received that night sir gawaine and his brother gaheris
then i was very greatly angered for it seemed to me that they were chasing that white hart out of despite of my lady and myself wherefore i followed after them with all speed
wait a little i will take full vengeance upon thee unto which sir gawaine said i will wait for thee as long as it shall please thee then the lord of the castle went into his chamber
she smote her hands together and shrieked with such shrillness and strength that it pierced the ears to hear her and she cried out
this sir gawaine overheard and he was exceedingly wroth thereat but he concealed his anger at that time only after he had gone away he said to gaheris his brother i believe that the lady hateth me with all her heart
so i came upon them at the outskirts of the woodland nigh to where there were a number of pavilions pitched in the shade of a glade of trees in the midst of the meadow
were riding through this forest together discoursing very pleasantly one time there appeared a lady unto them exceedingly beautiful and of very strange appearance
after that sir gawaine and his brother gaheris rode a considerable distance until they came by and by through a woodland into an open plain and it was now about the time of sunset
then sir gawaine leaped him down from his horse and drew his sword and slew the hart with a single blow of his weapon this he did in great haste but when he had done that and it was too late to mend it he repented him of what he had done very sorely
and i bore her away to this castle and here i have held her out of revenge because they pursued the white hart which belonged to my lady for my lady loved that hart as she loved nothing else in the world excepting myself sir said sir gawaine
abided with the knight and the lady and when the knight learned who sir gawaine was he felt it great honor to have so famous a knight in that place so they feasted together that evening in great amity
and gaheris followed after his brother so sir gawaine pursued the white hart into the courtyard of the castle and from thence it could not escape
sir i will spare thy life for i am very sorry for what i have done in my haste but the knight of the castle was filled with great bitterness because he thought that his lady was dead wherefore he cried out as in despair
which are not due to appear till april or may of the following year it is wonderful also how long life can be sustained by these creatures in the full-fed larva condition
people are often misled into the idea that the caterpillar forms the chrysalis over its former self whereas the chrysalis has been all the time forming inside the caterpillar
probably the treatment of the lawn does not suit them moaning and rolling upsetting their arrangements we will now consider these arrangements
is that this takes place sometimes as early as august in the year preceding their appearance so that the cells dug up in august may contain fully fledged insects
under notice and so passed unrecognized they may safely be left alone as they never seem to breed many consecutive years in one such locality
in this respect being quite different from worm casts which are formed of wet mould and the particles of which cling together sometimes causing considerable alarm as to the possible effect on the lawn
many people know the little red bee which for some apparently unaccountable reason suddenly appears in myriads on their lawn or gravel path throwing up little mounds of finely powdered earth
each of these she shapes more or less into the form of a cell provisions it with a small mass of pollen mixed with honey for the maintenance of the larva when hatched and lays her egg she then seals up that cell and proceeds to the next
after how long a period it's probably uncertain and appears in the nymph stage these states correspond to the chrysalis of a moth or butterfly the creature being shortened up and rather more like the perfect insect compacted into the smallest form possible
some of the most striking will be mentioned later on before leaving these general remarks on the solitary bees the habits of two genera must be specially noticed as they differ in an essential point from those of the others
and only shows itself when the final skin is shed of course some caterpillars spin a cocoon over themselves before they change their skin but then the true chrysalis is found inside the cocoon a curious fact connected with the change from the nymph to the perfect insect
gnaw their way out they in their turn are now making fresh burrows for their own broods possibly they infested someone else lawn the year before or were only in comparatively small numbers on the lawn
the life history of an ordinary pair of solitary bees is roughly as follows i will take for example one of the spring species of andrena
the account given of the nesting habits of the above andrena of our lawns et cetera it's more or less true of nearly all the solitary bees
and in this way fills up the burrow until pretty near the surface the bee caterpillar when hatched is a white grub-like creature which after devouring the food provided for it become more or less torpid it then makes its final change of skin
some years ago i collected a number of pierced bramble stems in order to breed out some of the small sandwasps which nest in them on opening them in may when the perfect insects are generally ready to appear i found that several of the larvae
these have hatched out from burrows made by their parents in the previous year the mouths of which have been filled up with earth and therefore are quite invincible till the newly fledged bees
the female bee so soon as she realizes that she's charged with the duty of providing for her future offspring makes a little heap which is so observable this burrow varies in depth from six to twelve inches and has short lateral branches
their methods vary some burrow in the ground some in old wood some in snail shells some in bramble stems or straws or the hollow stems of various plants some in holes or crevices in walls etcetera and their methods of building their cells
these are known to entomologists under the names of halictus and sphecodes in most species of these the males and females of the new brood are not hatched out until after midsummer and no work is done for the provisioning of new burrows that autumn
had rather shrunk up and had not changed into nymphs these i left in the stems covering them up again and they appeared as perfect insects in the may of the following year
vary exceedingly all of these are of great interest and some display an ingenuity which is quite surprising of these special nesting habits
in this respect they resemble the social bees and wasps about which more hereafter in the meanwhile a few words must be said about the cuckoos or inquilines which are perhaps the most interesting creatures of all
just as any ordinary spring bee would but there are no attendant males the duties of that sex having been performed in the autumn the larvae contained in these burrows hatch out after midsummer and therefore never spend a winter in the ground
but the female after having undertaken the duties of maternity hibernates for example goes back into a burrow and lives there till the next spring the males dying off before the winter in the spring the female wakes up and does the necessary work for the future brood
the whole treasure was efficiently and completely secured so completely did they succeed in keeping their own counsel and so successfully did their reputation keep pace with the cautious production of their undivulged treasures

and as his gaze wandered from one to the other it was easy to believe that he was asking each dumbly why had he ever been born is that edith's baby angelica exclaimed in her astonishment and horror under her breath
and in the drawing room after dinner she could not keep still mrs beale asked angelica to play and angelica tried something soothing at first but
and almost shook her in her consternation edith darling do you know what you are saying she demanded edith looked into her face in a bewildered way no mother what was it she answered
beside her she was reminded of the incident and described it to angelica adding i have so often longed to know what became of her i can tell you said angelica i know her quite well by sight she is living with
looking strangely haggard won't you come in and sit down a bit no thank you it is nothing edith answered steadily recovering herself
then more tears came because he was so very kind and finally she was obliged to go to her own room to recover herself as the day wore on however she became reassured
she will say that and i can't cure her nurse griffiths declared but i'm afraid you're feeling the heat ma'am and you are not very strong she added addressing edith who was clinging to the porch for support
lack of maternal affection will not be one of them have you seen the baby she asked elizabeth when the later was brushing her hair for dinner he had not been visible during the afternoon but angelica had thought of him incessantly yes miss elizabeth answered is he a pretty boy angelica wanted to know
on the three who were left the bishop was obviously uneasy doctor galbraith's good looking plainness was softened by a serious expression which added much to the attractiveness of his strong kind face
we pass the end of the lane where the cottage is edith agreed eagerly she said it would be a relief to her mind to know that the girl was well cared for and happy oh everybody is well cared for and happy on dr galbraith's estate said angelica his tenants worship him
what angelica a grown up young lady in a long dress she exclaimed where is diavolo we had a slight difference of opinion this morning angelica answered stiffly dear me that is a new thing mrs beale commented no it's not angelica contradicted
well enough it would be a noble thing to disregard the law and he gave her seventy-five pounds for that i found her letter to menteith about it and i've got
pray dearest she ejaculated i do i do mother edith wailed but they mingle with my prayers god is a demon isn't he mrs beale threw her arms around her daughter
i shall always think it was my fault well there is no call to do that if you didn't know the woman answered i see she was a great lady myself but i never thought it was her ah but it's the dirty men makes the misery on the way back edith stopped the carriage
then all outward sign of mrs beale's agitation subsided some shocks stun and some strengthen and steady us the piteous appeal in edith's eyes the puzzle and the pain of her face as she made an effort to recall her words and understand them had the latter effect upon her mother
i am afraid you are very weak dear child the poor lady bravely responded weakness makes people unhealthy minded you must see the doctor and have a tonic the doctor again edith groaned
unless making herself unusually agreeable was a symptom of commiseration and in this she succeeded so thoroughly that when the others rose to go edith did not feel inclined to part with her
menteith came after me and my sister wanted money so she made me believe that he couldn't marry me because there was a law to prevent it she said he loved me and if i loved him
at the telegraph office and despatched a message to her husband to come to her come at once they only arrived in time to dress hurriedly for dinner and when they went down to the drawing room they found dr galbraith there with the bishop and mrs beale
and she yielded to it now she began to feel more like herself i knew i should be better with you mother she said sighing and then she reached up her arm
sweet womanly nonsense said lady claudia she will twist them all round her little finger and turn the whole place upside down before she leaves
as she watched the child she had no smile for him and uttered no baby words to him-nor had he a smile for her he was old old already and exhausted with suffering
at herself in the glass what a little old man baby she exclaimed yes miss with a cold in his head the maid said seriously when she was dressed angelica went to make his acquaintance
her you know but tell him why we want him to come i am nervous about her mrs beale's face quivered and she burst into tears as she spoke oh my dear i am sure there is no need to agitate yourself the bishop exclaimed now do now don't clearly
then came a pause and then the chime rolled through the room a deafening volume of sound in long reverberations from amidst which the constant message
edith seemed much refreshed by her sleep and in the afternoon when the three ladies came from the castle to call upon her bringing angelica with them she quite roused up
that such deep devotion between father and daughter was an elevating and beautiful sight which it was a privilege to witness and tried to persuade herself that they were all extremely happy in the tranquil joy of this peaceful evening spent alone together with the world shut out
i have such terrible terrible thoughts i can't control them i can't keep them away the torment of my mind is awful i could kill myself mrs beale turned pale
came in from the dining room and then edith declared that driving in open air had made her so sleepy she must go to bed angelica noticed that dr galbraith scrutinized her face
beside her mother impetuously and buried her face in her lap take care dear child mrs beale exclaimed you will hurt yourself mother mother edith cried
and they were burnt out past all hope of rekindling them even the remembrance of what her feelings had been eluded her and she could think of nothing but after experiences experiences of her married life and those precisely which it was not wise to recall
and filled the air about it with balsamic fragrance edith and angelica left the carriage at the end of the lane and walked up what a lovely spot edith exclaimed
but the conversation flagged and mrs beale from wondering why edith was so uncommunicative found herself involuntarily repeating the bishop's observation that child is not right and the question what is the matter with your face dearest slipped from her unawares
but on the way to it she had to pass the room which had been hers as a girl the door was open and she went in nothing was changed there but the moment she entered she felt that there was a direful difference in herself
tantalized her now however because it did not renew it and turning from the picture impatiently she went to the window and there sank on to the seat from whence she had looked out at the moonlight and the shadows on the night
and then remembering the rapture with which she had been wont to kneel at his feet she looked again the recollection of the once dear delight
as missus beale said to the bishop afterward the dear naughty child quite took her out of herself angelica had never been in the same house with a baby before and she was all interest whatever defects of character the new woman may eventually acquire
and at once made proper allowances edith had got up when she had spoken and left the room she was occupying one of the state departments of the palace then
a stranger would have found it hard to believe that only the year before she had been radiantly healthy and beautiful the puzzled pathetic expression again in her eyes
chapter six the beales had not seen their daughter and grandson for some months and the appearance of both was a shock to them they said not a word to each other at first but neither of them could help looking at edith furtively from time to time on the evening of her arrival
but with pain and perplexity at her heart i am sure it is the journey she said it has quite upset you your nerves are all jarred you must really lie down for a little
coming away from the cottage and he spoke to us so shortly we were sure there was something bad the matter so we went to see what it was and nurse griffiths said she was french i've not been there since but i expect it's the same girl shall we stop and see
she managed however to speak to the girl about it kindly what is your baby's name she asked mosley menteith was the answer for a moment it seemed to edith as if all the world
angelica shivered and was about to break the spell of silence boldly in her energetic way when suddenly and apparently overhead a heavy bell tolled once
on a still bright day like this it makes one realize what the saints meant by holy calm i think i should like to live in such a place and never hear another echo from the outside world i suppose you would just like to add dear mosley to the establishment angelica suggested
on the way she discovered her particular friend the bishop going furtively in the same direction and slipped her hand through his arm we'll go together she said confidently taking it for granted that his errand was the same as her own
and she has been there ever since he always gets angry and snaps at you if he's bothered about anybody who's ill or unfortunate and diavolo and i met him that day
it has been nothing but the doctor and tonics ever since i have been married what does he say in the matter exactly mrs beale asked all his endeavour seems to be not to say what is the matter exactly edith replied mrs beale reflected caressing her daughter the while
see i will write at once he sat down and began my dear george and then looked up at his wife to see if she was not already relieved mrs beale could not speak but she stroked his head once or twice in acknowledgment of his great kindness
or i am much mistaken well dear if you would only make angelica do what you wish while you are here to influence her i should be thankful lady fulda rejoined with gentle dignity lady claudia said no more
and when i got well again i told them i had friends in morningquest and they gave me a little help to get there but i had to tramp most of the way and i was weak i couldn't have got as far as i did if i hadn't wanted to kill them both
see dearest here on the couch and keep quite quiet she arranged the cushions come dear she urged like a good child i'll cover you up edith had been accustomed to this kind of gentle compulsion all her life
who is that lady miss the nurse asked when edith was out of hearing lady menteith angelica answered the woman threw up her hands ohh lord have mercy upon her and upon us what a cruel cruel shame she's showing her the letter ah it's enough to kill her
i don't know mother edith answered shortly she had never before in her life spoken to her mother in that tone and the latter was surprised and hurt for a moment but then pursued herself that some irritability was only natural if the child were out of health
it was a habit of his to be polite to his wife i think you were right last night about edith she said she is not as she should be write to dr galbraith ask him to come here tomorrow ask him to dine and stay the night as if it were only an ordinary visit not to alarm
sharply as he shook hands with her god bless you my dear child the bishop said when she kissed him and his lips moved afterward for some seconds as if he were in prayer her mother followed her out of the room and then silence settled
as on other occasions before she realized what she was doing suddenly however she came to her senses and fled in affright to the morning room where she threw herself down on her knees
edith complained impatiently that those things always made her melancholy then angelica played some bars of patriotic music stirring in the extreme but edith stopped her again
you generally know all the mischiefs that's going miss why did you bring her here i wish i had known this then said angelica whose heart was thumping painfully if any harm comes of it
the french girl was standing at the door of the cottage with a child in her arms is nurse griffiths in angelica asked edith looked at the child
it should have been running about by that time but it was small and rickety with bones that bent beneath its weight slight as it was edith had looked at it first with some interest but its unhealthy appearance repelled her
when the bishop came up to the drawing room after dinner and settled himself in his accustomed easy chair edith had crept to his side and slipping her hand through his arm sat leaning her head against his shoulder
it here tapping the bosom of her gown he took me abroad when he wanted to get rid of me and left me in paris with five pounds in my pocket but it was enough to bring me back i was sick when i landed at dover and they send me to the workhouse
now hush said nurse griffiths the lord saved you from such a sin the lord said the girl derisively if the lord had been inclined to help me he wouldn't have waited till i came to murder it wasn't the lord saved me
well i'll stay angelica decided aunt fulda i'm going to stay here for a few days with edith she answered very well dear her aunt meekly rejoined are you going to stay now yes tell elizabeth to bring me some bathing apparel
that child is not right the bishop said when edith had gone to bed have you noticed her face i don't like the look of it at all not at all isn't that rather unkind dear misses beale replied i always recovered in time you never were as ill as the poor child evidently is he answered
and drew her mother's face down to hers kiss me mother and tell me you forgive me for being impatient dear child you are not impatient her mother answered adding to herself as she returned to her seat i hope it is only impatience
and letting the paper lie on his lap he sat silent also and serious feeling without in any way knowing that all was not well mrs beale was also depressed although she assured herself again and again
edith had not been on that road since her marriage and when they passed the place where she and her mother had seen the young french girl lying insensibly on the pathway with her baby
the chime rang out at this moment and she frowned as she listened to it i wish those bells could be stopped she exclaimed they deafen me mrs beale had also risen from her chair smiling mechanically
where have you two been the whole afternoon the letter ask we had tea in the library at fountain towers angelica answered easily and obtained some useful knowledge from your books dr galbraith looked hard at her i wonder what devilment you have been up to
mrs beale remonstrated you would if you were with us i expect angelica answered and then she turned her attention to edith but not by a sign did she betray the slightest consciousness of the latter's disfigurement
slipping her hand from the bishop's arms she had seen enough in one momentary glance and she fled from the room and the bishop followed her mrs beale was there when they entered and standing behind her daughter's chair
he thought but angelica's manner was as unconcerned as possible edith's was not however her face was flushed her eyes unnaturally glittering and she became excited about trifles and talked loudly at table
and retired to his library much disturbed but missus beale determined not to worry herself and managed to dismiss the subject from her mind until next day when she was sitting alone with her daughter in the morning room upstairs they were both working
the nurse was undressing the child when they entered and edith sat watching her she was already dressed for the evening and looked worse in an elaborate toilet than she had done in her morning dress
with these words the honourable adeline enfield sailed out of the room leaving me lost in astonishment absolutely bewildered at her behavior then i felt for the first time the bitter ingratitude of the world and i wept oh i wept abundantly
her third or fourth glass i exclaimed yes to be sure returned miss enfield what i thought every one knew that she drinks like a fish although she does do it on the sly her husband was a dreadful drunkard
at length the captain and adeline returned and we parted with our lovers promising to meet them again in a fortnight the two weeks passed away we met again and on this occasion the invitation to cholmondeley's house was renewed insisted upon and alas accepted
call me adeline in future answered miss enfield for now you and i are sworn friends yes the whole matter was pre-arranged so far as my meeting with cholmondeley was concerned and as i told him in my last note that you would accompany me he was too gallant not to engage a friend to take charge of you while he and i were conversing together
as i was hurried along in the post-chaise i looked ever and anon from the window oh there were the same objects i had before observed there they were apparently unchanged but i my god was i the same
my brain was a whirlwind my soul was a chaos and it was only with considerable mental effort that i could separate and classify my ideas in the slightest degree
my private residence is close by said the captain and if the ladies would take shelter there until the rain is over they shall be treated with as much respect as if they were at home well on that condition exclaimed miss enfield we will assent
the servant asked if i should like to see any of the young ladies and i answered in a manner which convinced her how i recoiled from the detestable proposal she smiled as i thought significantly as much as to say you will talk differently in a very short time
knows not how fearfully both are compromised both endangered when he so far forgets himself as to set foot in a house of infamy he may imagine that his secret never can transpire that neither his family nor friends can by any possible means ever discover that he has thus erred
and then induce to accompany them to their aunt's where they would meet some delightful girls of course this was mrs harpy's establishment the respectable country gentleman or clergyman was plied with more liquor and if he would not drink fast enough his wine was drugged for him
on the second floor the doors of several bedrooms stood open and i could not help admiring the comfort nay even the luxury which their interior revealed to the hasty glance that i threw into them these are the young ladies' rooms said jessica abruptly yours is higher up
nevertheless day after day i resolved to abandon my present mode of life retrace my steps to the home of my childhood throw myself at my father's feet confess all my errors implore his blessing and devote the remainder of my existence to penitence and virtue
then we had travelled by the coach and not so rapidly as i was now retracing the same path then too i had marked many of the most prominent features on the road and in the adjacent country here a church there a picturesque farm a cottage a mill or a hamlet
surely you cannot be in your senses my lord i exclaimed to talk of so serious a matter in such a flippant style come let us understand each other lydia he said i did not come to such a house as this to receive a lesson in morals
he insisted that i should pass a few weeks longer with his family until he could obtain for me a situation as governess i wrote to the lawyer of my native village and by return of post he forwarded me an order on a london banker for thirty-seven pounds the poor proceeds of the sale of the furniture in the parsonage house
when he awoke in the morning he would find himself in bed with one of the delightful girls presently one of the bullies would rush into the room declare that the gentleman had debauched his cousin and threaten an exposure
jessica took a good long stare at me then turning sharply round told me to follow her we proceeded up two handsome flights of stairs beautifully carpeted
but now perceiving the turn which matters had taken and that she herself was most solicitous to hush up the affair for the credit of her establishment i saw that no exposure awaited me and that i might save adeline from disgrace and ruin without farther compromising myself
lor sir says jane dimond when she has recovered the shock of surprise i thought you was dead and gone did you jane why because i fancied if you was in the land of the livin' you wouldn't have turned a deaf ear to that advertisement what advertisement
there is no difficulty about admittance this time jane diamond opens the door receives the letter and promises to post it that evening it is too late for any of the provincial mails but it is something to be assured that there shall be no needless delay
and the country post is gone ever so long i shall have to wait twenty-four hours before you can get her answer i can't help that says jane with an inflexible air she's trusted me and i'll do my duty by her as you've stayed away so long it can't hurt you to stay a little longer
i am known in my present circle only as miss faunthorpe all my hopes would be shipwrecked if i stood confessed as mrs secretan yet believe me there is no shadow of wrong to you in this concealment it is for our mutual welfare
he goes down to monsieur keel and skrew's office and enters upon the discussion of certain extensions and improvements in the australian branch of the business improvements which his experience of the colony has suggested to him
she told me to keep it a secret and i'm not going to tell no one without her permission says jane resolutely this resolve the husband combats but in vain i'll ask her leave to tell you and when i've got her leave i'll tell you answers jane wild horses wouldn't move me from that
stayed away so long cruel girl don't you know that it was she who left me whatever she did i make no doubt she did it for the best answers jane
her heart was still his he tells himself when she made that appeal to him whatever her scheme of life whatever game she was playing her heart was true to him
i'll go to a coffeehouse and write to her and bring the letter to you to post there's the silk gown for you all the same jane to show that i bear no malice oh sir cries the housemaid overcome by this generosity i couldn't think
but the mere fact that she has sought to obtain tidings of him is enough to melt his heart to change pride and anger to love and pardon whatever the exalted sphere in which you now move he writes you may be glad to know that your desertion has not quite been the death of me
the sandy haired footman is not impressed by mr secretan's appearance alexis is carelessly dressed in garments of a colonial cut a velveteen shooting jacket a soft felt hat clothes chosen for ease and hard wear rather than for fashion
he is well received and his views approved by mr keel the senior partner a gentleman with large ideas a palatial villa on clapham common vineries pineries succession houses and a stable which is a perennial source of profit to the horse dealers and the veterinary surgeon
where are you sibyl and with whom what has been your reward for deserting me has your scheme of life been a wise one have your hopes prospered
cook and footman whisper doubtfully for half a minute and then shut the door upon mr secretan leaving him to infer their acquiescence with his request
we won't go into particulars till you find out whether she's still here answers alexis coolly perhaps you will condescend so far as to inquire of your fellow servant hi cooky bawls the footman what's our jane's name diamond ain't it
he thinks about that advertisement as he goes back to the brompton road sibyl must have  cared for him a little despite her heartless abandonment of him or she would not have felt this anxiety to be informed of his fate
and whose chin is adorned with a tawny stubble like a newly cut wheat field the plate has all been sent to the bank alexis fairly bursts out laughing is there so much difference between a chimney-pot hat and a wide awake between poole and a colonial tailor he says to himself
there you see exclaims jane triumphant there's not a word about wanting to see you she only wants to hear from you heartless woman mutters alexis yet i'm glad she was just a little anxious to know my fate
you needn't think about it you've only to take the money and buy your gown i'll go and write my letter he goes to the nearest coffee house and writes to sibyl there is a touch of bitterness in the composition though his wounded heart is full of love for her all the time
i'll tell you what young man says the cook with asperity my missus is out of town and we don't want no airy sneaks loafing about while she's away and it ain't no good for them to loaf adds the sandy-haired young man who has not shaved for the last day or two
i have not starved or been driven to hang myself and i have come back from the other side of the world because i have a foolish hankering to know the fate of the woman who swore at the altar to love honour and obey me and kept her vow by abandoning me in my darkest hour of need
she would not have committed herself by an act likely to entangle her fate with his once having released herself from him she would have held herself altogether aloof she would have stretched no friendly hand across the gulf if she had not loved him
in a very little while dear my most anxious hopes will be realized the realization is so near that it would be worse than folly to sacrifice those hopes now as i must sacrifice them if i were to obey you and say come to me
and a well-spring of heart-burning and annoyance to its proprietor mr keel is a gentleman who talks of thousands as nieaner people talk of sixpences and is rumoured to have started in life thirty years ago as a stevedore and to have founded his fortunes upon the ill-gotten gains supposed to be inseparable from that function
dearest dearest dearest there is love's foolish rapture in a gush of pen and ink thank god for your dear letter though it is not altogether kind still it promises forgiveness for my wrongdoing and that is much thank god for the knowledge that you are living and well
and at exactly the same period has returned after the same interval has given her great parties at the same seasons and has lived a methodical and prosperous existence with satisfaction to herself and her neighbours and with considerable profit to the surrounding shopkeepers
comforted by this assurance he is inclined to be wondrously indulgent to forgive much should she but prove herself worthy to be forgiven he tries to occupy himself with hard-headed business during that weary interval in which he waits for sibyl's reply
of course it is you might have known answers cook who has come into the hall and now contemplates alexis over the youth's shoulder what do you want with jane dimond she inquires sharply there's no followers allowed here
whose curiosity is by this time raised to the highest pitch i shouldn't wonder if he was some aristocratic half brother of hers says cook who is a devoted student of reynolds's mysteries of london life is full of family secrets and such like
but simply because london in august is unendurable baking pavements scorched verdure dust and grime on everything and a sense of desertion in all those regions which the upper ten thousand and a considerable portion of the lower million inhabit
mr keel is pleased with mr secretan's suggestions you're about the only fellow i ever sent out who seems to understand the australian trade he says approvingly and i shall push you young man mark my words i shall push you
and then he adds aloud if one of you simpletons will take the trouble to call jane dimond she will be able to tell you that i'm a gentleman and that i have not come after the teaspoons or the umbrellas i'll wait in the street for her you can tell her that a gentleman from australia wants a few words with her
write and answer all these questions freely and fully if you recognise the tie which in the sight of god and man makes us two one tell me about our child the infant i have never seen yet whose baby face has haunted my dreams
i have contrived to live somehow though indignation against your cruelty has lacerated my heart and love for the wife who deserted me has proved an incurable disease
he paces the pavement for five minutes or so and then the good-natured jane dimond comes down the steps while cook and footman stand in the doorway to watch the proceedings
i'm not a follower answers alexis but i want to see jane dimond alone for five minutes on business the countenances of cook and footman plainly express an apprehension that this is the beginning of a deep laid scheme against the family plate
no it don't answers jane taking a tiny slip of paper out of her shabby old portemonnaie the advertisement says nothing of the kind she reads as follows
i ask from you patience and trust i give you my daily prayers my nightly dreams there is no wrong-doing in my scheme of life i injure no one least of all do i wrong you i only forego the happiness of sharing your life for a little while in order to make it brighter afterwards
you have given your babe to the care of strangers perhaps but i conclude you have watched over its welfare tell me further if there are in your life prosperous as it may be some few weaker moments when your heart yearns for reunion with the husband you once loved
he is swayed to and fro by diverse passions as he writes this letter now all bitterness now fond unreasoning love he has not the courage to read over his effusion but seals and addresses it hastily and hurries back to lowther street
i can say yes to both those questions i am on the road to high fortune fortune which you and i will share in happy days to come if you are as true to me as i am to you though seeming estranged
but it is a relief to be above ground for a little while after the twilight of those underground dungeons to which the london domestic is confined alexis mounts the steps and knocks and rings under the calm survey of those two pair of eyes
is there a young woman called dimond in service here now asks alexis dunno i'm shaw replies the flunkey with another yawn what do you want with her
jane dimond appears promptly and divining his impatience gives him the expected letter without a word he wrings her hand in speechless gratitude as if the letter were a boon from her bids her a brief goodnight and goes away with his prize
but no love i will show you an easier way do not stop to answer one of these questions write sibyl from your heart to mine tell me in three words to come to you and i will come
true to the fair young governess whose donations of lace and ribbon soiled gloves darned stockings and friendly smiles had won her heart years ago
the blinds are all down save one of the venetians in the dining room which is drawn up about halfway and in the space thus exposed to view the comfortable round face of mrs hazleton's cook and the lanky countenance of mrs hazleton's sandy haired footman
i long to see you my heart aches my soul sickens at the thought that we must wait for the hour of reunion but i am not so weak a slave to impulse as to abandon my prize just as it is almost won we must wait dearest
mrs hazleton is one of these eminently respectable personages she has occupied the house in lowther street for the last ten years she has gone to the seaside every year of those ten
the footman yawns audibly and when reminded of his duties by a nudge from cook's plump elbow mutters contemptuously oh hang it that fellow can wait you know and then withdraws himself lazily from his post of observation and anon opens the street door a little way filling the opening with his person
the last letter he received from her was that cruel renunciation that most heartless farewell the loosening nay the severing of every link between them she writes to him again there is communion between them once more the thought thrilled him she begins well at all events
see here jane says alexis unfolding a five-pound note here's something to buy you a silk gown for sundays now don't you think that you could contrive to tell me the address at once you know my wife wishes to see me the advertisement says that
i shall call for the answer the day after tomorrow in the evening you ought to have it by that time says alexis and it seems to him that the interval will be an unendurable space of time
i will come dear and all the past all that you have made me suffer shall be forgotten and forgiven in the rapture of our reunion yours forever if you will have it so alexis
a footman whose visage is happily unfamiliar to alexis exhibit themselves cook and footman are engaged in looking out of the window there is not much for them to see in lowther street on this august evening
the second day after mister secretan's interview with jane diamond has come and in the evening alexis knocks at the familiar door in lowther street with a heart that seems to beat louder than the knocker
the advertisement as miss faunthoipo i beg pardon mrs it never mind the name gl tell me all about the advertisement jane explains herself in a roundabout way but in due course alexis knows all that jane knows except his wife's present abode that the girl refuses to tell even to him
is she mad alexis asks himself indignantly after reading this letter does she think i am to be put off with loving words and assurances of constancy does she suppose that she can keep at a distance by concealing her address and writing to me under cover to a housemaid
when the london season is over mrs hazleton goes to the seaside not because she belongs to that flight of fashionable swallows who follow pleasure's summer from clime to clime
there are some people whose houses never change people whose habitations are in a manner symbolical of their lives and whose even tenor of existence nothing less than the undertaker can overthrow
he would rather read the letter in the street unwatched than open it ill misses hazleton's hall under the housemaid's friendly eyes yes it is from sybal in the hand he knows so well
why i thought you came home on sick leave youngster says the kindly clerk by jupiter i never saw anyone looking better all the effect of the voyage mr plowden i assure you i was a shadow when i went on board at sidney
my heart grew very heavy when that advertisement of mine remained unanswered you ask me if my scheme of life has realized what i counted upon if my hopes have prospered
they see jane gesticulate as in extreme surprise at sight of alexis and then the two walk a little further off quite out of earshot to the aggravation of jane's fellow servants
telegraph to her then directly cries alexis taking out a handful of silver come with me to the nearest telegraph office and i'll write the message for you you can put in the address yourself
s s to alexis you are not forgotten in all i do i am faithful to your interests i look forward to our reunion wait and hope as i do write and tell me where you are and what you are doing address s s post office hale street pimlico
he builds a delightful castle in the air and looks so well fed upon this nutriment of hope that samuel plowden scrutinizes him with a serio-comic expression when he returns to the outer office after his interview with mr keel
neither exile nor the sense of her unkindness have been strong enough to exclude her from his heart he may pretend to himself and to his friend dick plowden that he has ceased to love his wife that he seeks his child alone
write to me dear husband from time to time and let me write to you but let our correspondence pass through the hands of that good girl jane dimond i know your impulsive nature and i cannot trust you with my address for fear you should come here and destroy all my plans
cheered by this assurance alexis thinks what a nice thing it will be for him to go back to sidney with his wife and child for his companions if sibyl will but show herself true metal after all and if his child lives two formidable ifs
no i won't send her no telegraphs lest i should get her into trouble with her friends i'll write to her inexorable girl is she in the country yes
there could not be a better time for alexis to make his inquiry without having to present himself in a formal manner to his old acquaintance missus hazelton is at scarborough wth children governess and fernme de chambre
as for lin tai y when she found that pao y had gone out of doors she continued the whole day a prey to ennui in the evening she deputed messengers two and three times to go and inquire about him
she twisted herself round and endeavoured to run away but was tripped over by the doorstep this gave her such a start that she woke up then at length she realised that it was only a dream
you've again had too much to drink your face is scalding hot and if you still keep on rubbing and scraping it why you'll by and by stir up the fumes of wine
how could you ever be aware of the existence of the portentous passage in that buddhistic classic to the effect that a son of every person who holds the dignity of prince duke or high functionary
into pao yus face ai ya pao yu was heard to exclaim everyone in the whole room was plunged in consternation with precipitate haste the lanterns standing on the floor were moved over
and so distressed did she get that she gave mrs chao another scolding but while she tried to comfort pao yu she at the same time fetched more powder for counteracting the effects of the virus and applied it to his face
you bring up she berated her such a black-hearted offspring like this and don't you after all advise and reprove him
looking further for a sheet of blue paper she cut out five blue-faced devils which she bade her place together side by side with the paper men and taking a pin she made them fast
by a demoniacal art a junior uncle and an elder brother's wife pao y and lady feng come across five devils the gem of spiritual perception meets in a fit of torpor the two perfect men
mrs chao heaved a sigh look she said whether there will still be among them any pieces good for anything but anything that's worth anything doesn't find its way in there
tofu ejaculated mrs chao with a sigh were i a little better off i'd also come often and offer gifts but although my will be boundless my means are insufficient
but upon raising his head he descried in the southwest corner some one or other leaning by the side of the railing under the covered passage a crab-apple tree however obstructed the view and he could not see distinctly who it was
subject to no fixed rule and of course i feel bound to keep the lanterns alight on their behalf dowager lady chia nodded her head and gave way to reflection there's still another thing continued the taoist matron
when he explained that he had been scalded she forthwith shook her head and heaved a sigh then while making with her fingers a few passes over pao ys face she went on to mutter incantations for several minutes
don't you yet go and lie down quietly over there for a while chiding him the while she directed a servant to fetch a pillow pao y therefore lay himself down at the back of madame wang and called ts'ai hsia to come and stroke him
nothing of any great value answered the taoist matron ma exclusive of offerings of scented candles several catties of scented oil can be added each day to keep the lantern of the great sea alight
lin tai y imagined that the burn was of an extremely serious nature and she hastened to approach him with a view to examine it pao y however screened his face and waving his hand
yet it's fortunate that you don't trouble your minds about her for it's far better that you should let her have her own way my dear woman rejoined mrs chao not let her have her own way why is it likely that any one would have the courage to tell her anything
she was communing with her own thoughts but unawares perceiving hsi jen wave her hand and call her by name she had to walk up to her our watering-pot is spoilt hsi jen smiled and said
a day after ma a taoist matron whose name was recorded as pao-yu's godmother came on a visit to the mansion upon perceiving pao-yu she was very much taken aback and asked all about the circumstances of the accident
the next day pao y saw dowager lady chia but in spite of his confession that he himself was responsible for the scalding of his face his grandmother could not refrain from reading another lecture to the servants who had been in attendance
there you are again mrs chao replied you're one ever most ready to succor those in distress and to help those in danger and is it likely that you'll quietly look on while someone comes and compasses my death as well as that of my son
i don't mean to utter any words that may bring upon me retribution added ma the taoist matron but you people haven't got the wits but it's no matter of surprise
how is it she speedily urged that an intelligent person like you should have become so dense if indeed the spell prove efficacious and we exterminate them both is there any apprehension that this family estate won't be ours
but so restlessly did she in consequence of this fright keep on rolling and tossing that she could not close her eyes during the whole night as soon as the light of the next day dawned she got up
up to his larks with ts'ai hsia he could much less than ever stifle feelings of resentment in his heart after some reflection therefore an idea suggested itself to his mind and pretending that it was by a slip of the hand he shoved the candle overflowing with tallow
madame wang then ordered the servants to take care and escort pao y back to his room on their arrival hsi jen and the other attendants saw him and they were all in a great state of flurry
don't trouble yourself on this score suggested ma the taoist matron by-and-by when mr huan has grown up into a man and obtained some official post or other will there then be any fear of your not being able to afford such offerings as you might like to make
the other day mrs chao went on to inquire i sent a servant over with five hundred cash have you presented any offerings before the god of medicine or not i've offered them long ago for you the taoist matron ma rejoined
it's rather sore said pao y but it's nothing to speak of tomorrow when my old grandmother asks about it i can simply explain that i scalded myself
bade her leave the room for knowing her usual knack for tidiness he did not feel inclined to let her get a glimpse of his face tai yue then gave up the attempt and confined herself to asking him whether it was very painful
while mrs chao busied herself pasting shoes ma the taoist matron espied piled up on a heap on the stove-couch sundry pieces of silks and satins
pao y speedily walked out of the door with slipshod shoes under the pretence of admiring the flowers he glanced now towards the east now towards the west
and rinsing her hands and tying a sash around her waist she repaired directly to sweep the apartments who would have thought it pao yu also had his heart set upon her the moment he caught sight of her the previous day
yet dame chao should ever correct and admonish him this single remark suggested the idea to madame wang and she lost no time in sending for mrs chao to come around
and while her mouth was full of assent she stretched out her arm and first and foremost laid hold of the hard cash and next clutched the i o u
madame wang caressed and patted him but while pao y clung to his mother's neck he spoke to her of one thing and then another my child said madame wang
at these words mrs chao gave a smile enough enough she cried don't again refer to such contingencies the present is a fair criterion
madame wang at once assailed him with questions she asked him how many ladies had been present on that day whether the play had been good or bad and what the banquet had been like
then getting the water pot she sped on her way back again but being in low spirits she retired alone into her room and lay herself down one and all however simply maintained that she was out of sorts so they did not pay any heed to her
all of them were rouged and powdered they had flowers inserted in their hair and were grandly got up but the only one of whom he failed to get a glimpse was the girl he had met the day before
while uttering this remark she stretched out her two fingers ma the taoist matron understood the meaning she desired to convey it's your lady secunda lien eh she forthwith asked
it fell a prey to fears also lest when dowager lady chia made any inquiries about them she should find it difficult to give her any satisfactory reply
madame wang found out however that dowager lady chia would not avail herself of the invitation and neither would she go so mrs hseh went along with the lady feng and the three sisters of the chia family and pao chai and pao y and only returned home late in the evening
these two were in the act of wrangling when verily chia huan overheard what was going on he had in fact all along hated pao y so when on this occasion he espied him
when i get home she remarked i'll have recourse to some art which will beyond doubt prove efficacious when she however had done speaking she suddenly saw madame wang's waiting-maid make her appearance inside the room
so advancing a step further in he stared with intent gaze it was in point of fact the waiting-maid of the day before tarrying about plunged in a reverie
but when she came to know that he had been scalded she hurried in person to come and see him she then discovered pao all alone holding a glass and scanning his features in it while the left side of his face was plastered all over with some medicine
at one time she issued directions to the servants to rub and wash pao-yu clean at another she heaped abuse upon chia huan lady feng
it isn't very sore replied pao-yu if i look after it for a day or two it will get all right but after another short stay lin tai-yu repaired back to her quarters
several waiting maids came at once to tell her to go and sweep the floors of the rooms and to bring water to wash the face with hsiao hung did not even wait to arrange her hair or perform her ablutions but turning towards the looking glass she pinned her chevelure up anyhow
turning then towards mrs chao she asked for a sheet of paper and taking up a pair of scissors she cut out two human beings and gave them to mrs chao enjoining her to write on the upper part of them the respective ages of the two persons in question
the consort of the mansion of the prince of nan au had been prompted in her beneficence by a liberal spirit she allows each day forty-eight catties of oil and a catty of wick so that her great sea lamp is only a trifle smaller than a water-jar
pao yu then began to bandy words with ts'ai hsia but perceiving that ts'ai hsia was reserved and that instead of paying him any attention she kept her eyes fixed upon chia huan pao yu eagerly took her hand my dear girl he said do also heed me a little
dreadful she then said to the taoist matron dreadful but speaking of this sort of mistress i'm not so much as a human being if she doesn't manage to shift over into her mother's home the whole of this family estate
that will be quite enough to tell her if you say that you scalded it yourself lady feng observed why she'll also call people to task for not looking out and a fit of rage will beyond doubt be the outcome of it all
our young master won't i fear be equal to the gift and instead of being benefited his happiness will be snapped if you therefore want to make a liberal gift seven catties will do if a small one then five catties will even be sufficient
for a whole day and a whole night asked dowager lady chia how much oil is needed so that i too should accomplish a good action there is really no limit as to quantity it rests upon the goodwill of the donor ma the taoist matron put in by way of reply
if you don't despise what's worthless you're at liberty to select any two pieces and to take them away and have done the taoist matron ma chose with alacrity several pieces and shoved them in her breast
chia huan accordingly came and seated himself on the stove-couch occupied by madame wang and directing a servant to light the candles he started copying in an ostentatious and dashing manner
take these she said in advance for presents in your temple at the sight of the various articles and of the promissory note the taoist matron became at once unmindful of what is right and what is wrong
hsiao hung the story continues was much unsettled in her mind her thoughts rolled on in one connected string but suddenly she became drowsy and falling asleep she encountered chia yn who tried to carry out his intention to drag her near him
for up to whom in this house can my son and i come pao is still a mere child but he is such that he wins people's love those big people may be partial to him and love him a good deal i've nothing to say to it but i can't eat humble pie to this sort of mistress
in my quarters for instance i have several lanterns the gifts of the consorts of princes and the spouses of the very high officials living in various localities
well in that case responded dowager lady chia let us fix upon five catties a day and every month come and receive payment of the whole lump sum
but a brief interval over pao-yu too appeared on the scene after saluting madame wang he also made a few remarks with all decorum and then bidding a servant remove his frontlet divest him of his long gown and pull off his boots he rushed head foremost into his mother's lap
jumped onto the stone couch by leaps and bounds but while intent upon removing the stuff from pao y's face she simultaneously ejaculated master tertius are you still such a trickster i'll tell you what you'll never turn to any good account
and she bethought herself that labourers were that day to plant trees in that particular locality at a great distance off a band of men were in very deed engaged in digging up the soil while chia yn was seated on a boulder on the hill superintending the works
presently she entered mrs chao's apartments after the two ladies had exchanged salutations mrs chao bade a young servant-girl hand her guest a cup of tea
time and again i paid no notice whatever to what happened and you and he have become more audacious and have gone from worse to worse
he did not either in the second place have any idea what her disposition was like the consequence was that he felt downcast so much so that when he got up at an early hour he did not even comb his hair or wash but simply remained seated and brooded in a state of abstraction
his wish was to go forward and meet her but he did not on the other hand see how he could very well do so just as he was cogitating within himself he of a sudden perceived pi hen come and ask him to go and wash his face
are you pray fearful lest i shouldn't give you any reward ma the taoist matron greeted this remark with a smile you're right enough in what you say she ventured of my being unable to bear the sight of yourself and son receiving insult from a third party
o mi to fu desist at once from asking me she designedly exclaimed how can i know anything about such matters contrary as they are to what is right
so go to miss lin's over there and find one for us to use hsiao hung hastened on her way towards the hsiao hsiang kuan when she got as far as the ts'ui yen bridge she saw on raising her head and looking round the mounds and lofty places entirely shut in by screens
or knock there his bowl of rice down during meal time or give him a shove and send him over while he is quietly seated so this is the reason why the majority of the sons and grandsons of those distinguished families do not grow up to attain manhood
but as for your mention of rewards why what's there of yours that i still covet this answer slightly reassured mrs chao's mind
need you tell me this ma the taoist matron at these words remarked with a view to ascertain what she implied haven't i forsooth discovered it all for myself
it just happens she consequently remarked that i have no facings for shoes so my lady do give me a few odd cuttings of silk and satin of no matter what colour to make myself a pair of shoes with

a day went by on the morrow fell in fact the anniversary of the birth of wang tzu tengs spouse and some one was despatched from his residence to come and invite dowager lady chia and madame wang
misses chao was filled with trepidation hastily waving her hand she got to her feet raised the portiere and peeped outside perceiving that there was no one about she at length retraced her footsteps
yet if you daren't openly do anything why you should stealthily have devised some plan and do you still tarry up to this day misses chao realized that there lurked something in her insinuation and she felt an inward secret joy what plan could i stealthily devise she asked

clasping the tiny dead hand lost to everything save the recollection of her child and insensible to all outward sights and sounds
but it was kindly veiled from her she kissed the little white brow and did not see the seal set there she looked into the eyes but did not perceive the strange fatal light in them
i am so tired mamma was her constant complaint she was sickening her mother saw it with what alarm can be readily imagined she sent for the doctor but he only shook his head and ordered a nourishing diet and wine
the good woman repeated the toast but didn't drink the wine which she pronounced sour as vinegar on this day the schoolmaster was laid aside and the count de lavalle presided at the frugal table
when the question was one of their own personal safety so the count de lavalle retired to his chateau in disgust he had troubled himself he said to assemble a force for the protection of these others and they disregarded the honour
by degrees aimee began to look forward to that event and to connect it with a great many things mamma will my little girl in the picture come and play with me when the ship comes home she asked one day
i do not understand you who will respect him when he has for a wife the discarded and suspected daughter of a french teacher at a school in binchester
the old gentleman however had his family pride and there was no fear of reginald's being superseded as long as he did nothing to bring himself into disgrace
valerie hastened home and taking a peep at her child went down to prepare the beef-tea with the poor scrap of meat she had purchased how tedious the process seemed the tiny teacupfull of water stood simmering slowly it seemed an hour
her father was far from delighted at the acquisition morhleuy if it had been an italian greyhound or a well-bred dog of any description but this mongrel ma chere valerie i fear you have not taste this of a de lavalle
he might forgive his marrying the child of an english beggar in the streets but not the daughter of a french king ah me what is to be done sighed valerie but
she had of late begun to dread this but she never thoroughly realized it until it came what have i done said the old man fiercely that this dishonour falls upon me in my old age that my grey hairs are disgraced
oh how i wish i could go see it sailing in with its purple silk sails and its gold mast and its fluttering flags will papa come with the ship mama
but she is reserved and silent and even those who bless her have seldom seen her it is supposed that she and her husband sir reginald live no less happily together than other married people
i will ride home as quickly as i can and send you some restoratives and tonics this is a terrible change he took his guinea never noticing how poor valerie had to struggle with an inclination to ask him to let her keep it and wait a little for his fee
as this kind of keel was appropriately styled many boats of this pattern were soon afloat most of them highly successful at home and abroad and carrying a surprising spread of canvas
at the other extreme the havana yacht club has american members who take their boats to the west indies every winter bermuda is another favorite resort
nevertheless when the galatea whose challenge had been postponed until eight and eighty-six came out the puritan had already been distanced by an american rival the mayflower practically a larger copy of herself as galatea was of genesta and therefore a lead keeled center board boat having a cutter like rig
and is in reality a yachtsman under all circumstances at all times and in all weathers he must be cool-headed and calm in times of peril affable and courteous on all social occasions and generous and prompt to respond to all calls upon his courage in brief a gentleman
a true buckeye is a double-ender but some large ones have been built with an overhang stern which destroys the ideal and creates a new kind of craft
and to the prevalence of bays or protected lagoons such as narragansett bay the great south bay of long island new york harbor delaware and chesapeake bays and the long series of sounds that border the southern atlantic coast from barnegat to biscayne
that in early times formed almost the only type of small sailboat in new york waters two other novel foreshadowing features possessed by mr stevens' boat were the use of rubber compressors on the traveler of the main boom to ease the strain of the sheet
keel catboats are also built but the typical american cat is the center board boat of light draft big beam and huge sail the two objectionable points about boats of this class are their capsizability and their bad habit of yawing when sailing before the wind
and bearing good fruit a year later in the launching of the mischief an american center board sloop but modified in accordance with the new theories the plumb stem
even with her sloop rig she was a marked departure from the older boats of her class especially as she was built of iron in place of wood and consequently carried her ballast all lead at a very low point
large sharpies have been built with fine cabin accommodations and such boats are particularly adapted to the shoal waters of the south they are fast sailers but owing to their long narrow bodies and light draft are not always trustworthy they are cheaper to build than boats of other designs
one of the results of this controversy was the sending to this country from scotland of a little ten-ton racing cutter the madge purely to show that capabilities lay in a deep narrow lead keeled craft with the typical cutter rig
that is to say their ballast consists of bag of sand which are shifted to windward with every tack and thus serve to keep the yachts right side up a boat ballasted in this manner can carry more sail than rightly belongs on her sticks
the average yachting man if he be of that stuff of which good seamen are made soon finds his chief delight in being master of his own vessel he likes to feel that it is his skill his prowess his intellect that rule the ship in which he sails
the straight sheer and higher free board with quite a sharply though short overhang suggested the hull of the cutter and though quite wide nearly twenty feet on sixty-one feet water line she drew nearly six feet
this new claimant for yachting favor was like the raft of the south sea islanders only in name in fact it was not a catamaran at all but a new device for racing over the water by means of sails
and when in eighteen forty-four the new york yacht club was founded the conditions were favorable for beginning that home development of yachting as a sport which was soon to place the americans and canadians among the leading yachting peoples of the world
on the pacific coast wherever there is a bay that will afford a harbor and a town that will support people the yacht is used as a vehicle of pleasure many of the san francisco boats are large schooners
was of course a rowboat with a sail from the primitive sprit sail pleasure boat comes the ever present and universally favored center board catboat a type of yacht which for speed handiness and unsafeness has never been surpassed
one of that family of remarkable inventors who had already devised the first practical screw steamer and afterwards created the monitor her model as we learn from an excellent article in the century for july eighteen eighty-two by samuel g w benjamin
and the rig was essentially that of the cutter rather than of the sloop a struggle decided that she was better than the priscilla and in the cup races in september she proved herself better than the famous english cutter genesta
pacific yachters appreciate the good points of the yawl for the squalls which blow over the waters of the west coast are sudden and severe and no rig meets these conditions of weather so well as does the yawl
to meet this a scientific designer of marine vessels mr a cary smith of new york was called upon to produce a moderately deep center board iron sloop yacht on the lines of the mischief but much larger and he produced the priscilla
though the first regatta in america was sailed in eighteen forty five little over half a century ago the evolution of american yachts began with the building of the sloop maria by robert l stevens
up to this time as mr w p stephens tells us in the century for august eighteen ninety three when many of the portraits of these races have been taken no pleasure boats had been built except after the rule of thumb
that they sometimes make outside voyages without either cargo or ballast but the maria had a long sharp hollowed bow whence she expanded aft with little taper at the stern so that her deck plan was that of an elongated flat iron
in earliest times a mat was hung over the side later this was replaced by the leeboard apparently a dutch invention which may still be seen on the canal barges in holland and which was a feature of the pirogues or periaugers shallow double-ended sailing canoes
the latter meaning alone is now kept in view by the word which is properly applied to anything designed and used for pleasure sailing whether moved by sails steam or electricity
the cutter has a sail set from her stem to her masthead the sloop has not this sail is called a forestay sail and its presence marks the cutter rig
but while she was building there was quietly begun another yacht the puritan owned and built in boston from designs by an almost unheard of architect mr edward burgess who previously to this performance had been renowned only as a student of insects
as this contest was between single representative yachts tried in five races and in all sorts of weather it was a fair and conclusive measure of comparative qualities the next yacht to come after the international cup was the canadian countess of dufferin
the next year however another challenge was received and the british keel yacht livonia appeared and was defeated by the american keel schooner sappho which under a new rule had won her right to defend the cup by first beating in preparatory ocean races all other rivals for the honor
passing the sandbaggers the next popular and most universally used yacht is the ballasted sloop a sloop may be a center board boat or a keel boat or a combination of both she has only one mast and carries a topmast
has culminated in a linking for certain classes of very small boats single handers they are called and this linking has given impetus to the building of some little vessels which are really marvels in their way
a few years ago the sailing public was surprised by the appearance upon the waters of a spider-like contrivance which its friends said was a
in great britain where yachting as we now understand it arose it was not until about sixteen fifty the traces between pleasure craft began to be sailed on the thames and in the quiet waters about the isle of wight
who gives to the sport its wide popularity and makes yachting so universally loved by men who are fond of aquatic pleasuring the small yachter is everywhere upon the waters from the coast of the maine from the shores of the harbor of the golden gate
which was promptly defeated by the magic in eighteen seventy six five years later another canadian appeared the atalanta differing from previous contestants in being a single-masted center board yacht
it is the most convenient form of a very old device for preventing a boat's drift to leeward or tendency to capsize under the pressure of the wind
fifteen yachts responded but none showed what it could do for there was little wind and the cup was awarded to the america more in general acknowledgment of its excellence than because of any great performance there
the principal novelty about her however was the use of two center boards a center board is a plate of wood or metal suspended usually by a corner pivot within a sheath or box in the waist which can be let down through the keel into the water so as to form an adjustable keel
by this time however there was peace on the north atlantic and many a good seaman was free to turn his attention to enjoying and improving the tools of his profession
in design they are like the catboats the only difference being in their rig these two boats the center board cat and the jib and mainsail sloop are what yachters call sandbaggers
and to lead to those international tests of speed that nowadays excite so widespread and intense an interest the great preponderance in numbers and value of pleasure vessels in the united states
some practical sailor whittled out a model according to his ideas and the builder followed it systematic designing was unknown and one type of yacht was in general use the wide shoal center board craft
and finding this complete mastery of the vessel to be impossible aboard a big boat he longs for one which he can handle alone this independent and sportsmanlike instinct of the american yachter
and the scene of lively races with a local narrow sort of craft called a flyer which will beat almost anything if only it can be kept right side up
and in eighteen thirty-three was again recognized by king william iii at the royal yacht squadron the designation it bears today it carried on races or regattas as they soon came to be called borrowing from the italians a term descriptive of the old venetian gondola races
yet the cat is the handiest light weather boat made it is very fast quick in stay and simple in rig but it can never become a first class seaworthy type of yacht it belongs among the fair weather pleasure boats
another challenge immediately came from glasgow supported by a boat named thistle built under the new rule and to oppose it mr burgess built the volunteer which differed from its predecessors mainly in increased draft and tendency toward the cutter model
in eighteen twelve a yacht club was founded at cowes in the isle of wight it received a new impetus and became the royal yacht club in eighteen seventeen the prince regent having joined it
the year eighteen ninety three brought another challenge for the cup in the person of lord dunraven sailing the yacht valkyrie but he was met by a new well-proved herreshoff fin keel the vigilant built of a new alloytobin bronze and handsomely defeated
it is worthy of notice that nearly all yachters who cruise about in summer and especially those who are fond of speedy boats use either sloops or cutters and it is remarkable to see how much comfort can be found in boats of these types even when quite small
by beating everything in existence until a swedish gentleman in new york constructed a much smaller boat the coquette on very different lines for although only sixty-six feet long she drew ten feet of water
and in a match on the open sea she beat the maria easily showing the superiority of the deep keeled model for windy weather profiting by these experiences and widely gathered information a new designer essayed the task of making a still better yacht
from the beaches of the atlantic seaboard and from the borders of the island lakes he can be seen all summer long sailing about in his little vessel and enjoying in all its fullness the excitement and delight of the most noble and health-giving sport
her sails are many and like the cutter she is permitted to carry clouds of canvas in a race technically speaking a cutter differs from a sloop only in one point as the terms sloop and cutter really apply to the rig of the yacht
a number are powerful sea-going sloops while of smaller craft there is an abundance of almost every type although the new york catboat and the flat-bottomed sharpie of long island sound are seldom met with and seem not to be in favor
they are common on the coast waters south of the delaware bay and are used chiefly for hunting boats their cheapness handiness and roominess rendering them useful to the sportsman
trial races showed that the mayflower was able to beat all her beautiful predecessors and again the british contestant was obliged to take a defeat and leave the prize in new york
with a pluck and energy that mark the true lover of the sea and a tact and skill that bespeak the real sailor he handles his little craft in fair weather and in foul in a manner that leaves no room for doubt as to its fitness for the work which he is doing
she was everywhere a winner and was immediately followed by a smaller boat the dilemma whose keel was an almost rectangular plate of steel the ballast which alone was trusted for stability being in the form of a cigar-shaped cylinder of lead bolted to the lower edge of the fin
while the first yacht-club was not formed until seventeen twenty at cork in ireland even then a century elapsed before yachting as a sport attracted much attention even among the british famous for their love of the sea
her hull was also novel consisting of a double skin of thin wood on steel frames while the upper part of the hull projected excessively at both ends
who about eighteen seventy-seven called into question the merits of the american center board sloop and pointed out the opposing qualities of the british cutter her non-capsizability due to the use of lead ballast outside of the hull
the great lakes are bordered by yacht clubs on both sides and furnish space and weather for quite as serious work as tries the skill of ocean navigators while a hundred smaller lakes make fine pleasure waters and excellent training-grounds for fresh-water sailors
the result of this last contest in eighteen eighty-six was to cause british yachtsmen to abandon their old tonnage rule of measurement and adopt the far better modern one of load line and sail area measurement
she easily beat the thistle and the discouraged foreigners rested for some years before trying again to wrest from us the coveted trophy in eighteen ninety-one however there came to new york from the yards of the herreshoff brothers
but her rigging and finish were so bad that her excellent model could not save her from defeat in eighteen eighty-one at the hands of the elegant iron sloop mischief which had been built especially for the race and had won her foremost place through severe trial race as before
but she cannot be very safe or comfortable her place in the regatta it is not beyond the truth to assert that the sandbaggers constitute probably two fifths of the total of small yachts
such was the style of the day but later she was changed in rig so as to carry far more and bigger sails more like those of a modern schooner-yacht the moment she arrived in cowes in the early summer of eighteen fifty one her superiority in speed was conceded
for small cruising yachts it is an excellent rig and preferable to the cat rig cat yawls are also in use they are merely yawls without jibs with such rigs as these a yachter can go alone upon the water without fear of trouble and with no need of assistance
but all sorts of cruising boats were matched against one another classified by a tonnage rule with no allowances for size or any of the systems by which contestants are now classified and equalized
they will never cease to be popular for the reason that speed and sport are synonymous terms with a great many yachters and no one can deny that these boats like brother jasper's sun do move
rubber is applied in many places about modern rigging and the bolting of lead to the keel as outside ballast the maria justified the expectations aroused by these and other novelties in hull and rig
was suggested by the low broad almost flat-bottomed sloop employed to steal over the shallows of the hudson and the sound vessels depending upon beam rather than on ballast for stability and imitated by many of our coasters which are so stiff
then the question arose what should be done to meet them the british cutters differed from those previously met in that they were built for racing not for general use were racing machines instead of cruising yachts
the following season the vigilant went to england and found herself equally overmatched by the britannia owned by the prince of wales while valkyrie ii was wrecked
the most important and numerous yachting interest of the country however as would be expected is along the northeastern seaboard where measured by numbers and the investment in boats wharves clubhouses and equipment generally it surpasses any other district in the world
faulty in every way as this type has since been proved in the absence of any different standard it was considered perfect and open doubts were expressed of the patriotism if not the sanity of the few american yachtsmen
for whether he sail alone or with the help of his friends or that of a hired man to run his boat he is always the master of his vessel which is seldom the case with the proprietor of the big boat
this was george steers the son of a british naval captain and ship modeler who had become an american naval officer and was the first man to take charge of the washington navy yard
naturally with men of moderate means who love the water these small single handers have become very popular some of them are not over sixteen feet long
from the center board catboat grew the jib and mainsail sloop a type of yacht which has always been noted for its great speed and general unhandiness small yachts of this kind are always racers and the interest in racing is sufficient to keep them in the lists of popular boats
and in the number of clubs and club members is due not only to our large population and long coastline but to the great extent of inland waters furnished by our rivers and interior lakes
had acquired a skill in building and rigging ships that astonished the world by their speed and weatherly qualities it was natural that these ideas should influence pleasure craft on this side of the water as great britain's long sea struggles had influenced its sailors
and no british captain would consent to meet her but finally a match was extemporized open to all nations for which a prize was offered in the form of a cup presented by the royal yacht squadron not by the queen as usually said
simplicity and handiness of rig have been considered in their construction and this has led in many cases to the adoption of what is known as the yawl style a rig which for safety and convenience has never been surpassed by any other the yawl is really a schooner with very small mainsail
the only american able to beat her was the shadow a famous herreshoff sloop of unusual depth and she did it but once nevertheless the controversy was not decided in the united states and the britishers thought it worthwhile to try to give us another lesson
this new boat completed in the spring of eighteen fifty-one and named america was schooner-rigged but had raking masts no topsails except a small main gaff and only one jib whose foot was laced to a boom
the term cutter however is usually applied to the long narrow deep keeled vessel and has in common parlance grown to mean a boat of that type it is in that sense that it is general understood
with high trunk cabin large open cockpit ballast all inside and of iron or even slag and stone and a heavy and clumsy wooden construction
besides marrying a man like that allowing him an assured position in society is countenancing vice and she glanced round apprehensively then added in a fearful whisper helping to spread it
or mere passive perception and the feeling which emanated from mrs orton beg is one that is especially contagious for in the first place the beauty of goodness appeals pleasurably to the most depraved
mrs beale with pleasure also but with more ceremony edith quite simply and naturally and then she sat down he was in riding dress with his whip and hat in his hand this is an unexpected pleasure i did not know you were at morne
my dear child she gasped what has happened why are you here nothing has happened auntie don't be alarmed evadne answered
i read it before i went downstairs and at first i could not think what to do so we drove off together but on the way to the station it suddenly flashed upon me that the proper thing to do would be to go at once and hear all that there was to tell
in the afternoon of that same day she went out alone for a walk and did not return and they became alarmed at last and sent some men to search for her when the storm was at its height and they found her lying across a stile she had been killed by the branch of a tree falling on her
but i was mistaken it was a mere affair of the senses to be put off by the first circumstance calculated to cause a revulsion of feeling by lowering him in my estimation
a vague haunting family likeness which continually obtruded itself but could not be defined it had been more distinct when evadne was a child and would doubtless have grown greater had she lived with her aunt
my appetite is delicate it requires to be tempted and a husband of that kind a moral leper she broke off with a gesture spreading her hands palms outward as if she would fain put some horrid idea far from her
then she straightened herself as if collecting her energy and began to speak yes i am married she said
he watching over israel slumbers not nor sleeps my heart swells i leave all that is inexplicable to him and thank him for the love and the hope with which he feeds my heart and keeps it from hardening
but the very different mental attitude which she gradually acquired had melted the resemblance as it were so that at nineteen although her slender figure and air and carriage continually recalled mrs orton beg who was then in her thirty-fifth year
did you feel the storm much here he asked my trees have suffered a great deal i am sorry to say ah that reminds me mrs beale began a very strange and solemn thing happened on the day of the storm have you heard of it olive
compared to the disabilities which being a girl imposes upon her but she means to get over them all by hook which she explains as being the proper development of her muscles and physique generally
the governess was wearing some scarlet geranium you know what they say if people are seen like that where they have never been in the body she said jokingly
they put me in my place every time i see them the last time we had a serious talk together i noticed that diavolo was thinking deeply
that they will have the best of everything and if the best wives are only to be obtained by being worthy of them they will strive to become so as it is however why should they
mournful melodious yet glad too in the strength of its solemn assurance filling the desolate regions of sorrow and silence
diavolo gallantly assured her bowing in the most courtly way but angelica said with more force than refinement that that was all rot
said mrs orton beg is claudia with you no i have only come for a few days lord dawne replied i came to see adeline specially
watching the newly lighted fire burn up and thinking she was thinking of evadne chiefly wondering why she had had no news of her
so long as women like you will forgive anything men will do anything you have it in your power to set up a high standard of excellence for men to reach in order to have the privilege of associating with you there is this quality in men
but when i went to change my dress after the ceremony i found this letter it was intended you see to reach me some days before it did but unfortunately it was addressed to fraylingay and time was lost in forwarding it
no not very much i assured him why well i was pretty certain you didn't he replied and you see i do so i was just thinking couldn't you remain as you are when grandpa dies
angelica broke in in her energetic way if you're going to be a duke i won't be left plain miss hamilton wells you couldn't be plain miss anything
and for the strength of character which had enabled her so far to act upon them you must obey your own conscience evadne was what she found herself saying at last i will help you to do that i would rather not influence you you may be right i cannot be sure and
and then there was a pause and then the chime rolled out over the storm stained city
when the last reverberation of the last note had melted out of hearing evadne sighed
again mrs orton beg felt herself checked where did you hear all this evadne she asked i never heard it i read and i thought
evadne compressed her lips in steady disapproval i should think only of his future i should forgive the past that is the mistake you good women all make said evadne you set a detestably bad example
tilting at each other with long pole of dukedom angelica says she means to beat demosthenes hollow i use her own phraseology to give character to the quotation that delivering orations with a natural inclination to stammering was nothing to get over
and shrank appalled by the thought of what the cruel struggle to come must be if evadne persisted in her determination in view of this she sat up in her chair once more energetically
she handed it to her aunt who raised her eyebrows when she saw the writing as if she recognized it hastily drew the letter from its envelope and held it so that the blaze fell upon it while she read
and discovered that he had something else in his mind the whole time i was just wondering he answered if you care much about being duke of morningquest
oh that was very simple lord dawne rejoined diavolo dressed in velvet was caught and taken up by a policeman for recklessly driving a hansom in oxford street angelica being inside the same disguised in something of her mother's
i thank him too she went on hoarsely for the terrible moments when i feel my loss afresh those early morning moments
evadne asked at last caressingly i do not like to hear you talk so evadne every word you say seems to banish something something from this room something from my life to which i cling
why her sister elizabeth did not write and tell her all about the wedding and she was just on the verge of anxiety in that state when various possibilities of trouble that might have occurred to account for delays begin to present themselves to the mind
and she cherished the certainty of one day assuming a wondrous form and entering upon a new life as vivid and varied and as real as this but far more perfect
a thing so slight that after reading the letter as we drove to the station even so soon i could see him as he is i noticed that although his face is handsome the expression of it is not noble at all
the matter was not nearly so bad as it might have been in consequence mister hamilton wells had to pay a fine for the furious driving and use all his influence with the press to keep the thing out of the papers but where did the children get the hansom
which every sentient being must perceive with emotions that vary from extreme repugnance to positive pleasure through diverse intermediate strata of lively interest
and drove off to the general post office to telegraph to my people but why didn't you go home for several reasons evadne answered
to ask you for shelter from the world for a few days because i have been a fool may i stay surely dear child
they say it is a sign that the person is going to die in the afternoon mrs beale continued lowering her voice and glancing round involuntarily and in the momentary pause the rush of the gale without sounded obtrusively
and yet i don't agree with you for i know if i could have my husband back with me i would welcome him even if he were a leper
she answered but i am only now beginning to understand she added i suppose moral axioms are always the outcome of pained reflection
mrs orton beg smiled at her affectionately but before she could speak the door opened once more and the servant announced lord dawne
and hoped for a moment that it was about what i was saying but that apparently had not interested him at all for i had the curiosity to ask just to see if i had perchance made any impression
her large dark luminous eyes and delicate refined features all set in a wistful sadness there was a singular likeness between herself and evadne in some things
she shuddered as at the sight of something repulsive you see she explained my taste is cultivated to so fine an extent i require something extremely well-flavoured for the dish which is to be the pice de resistance of my life feast
and they would return time after time to dispute her conclusions and argue themselves out of the impression she had produced but only to relapse into their former state of blissful sensation so soon as they once more found themselves within range of her influence
and she raised her head to listen one two three four the round notes fell
i am here because i have been a fool she spoke quietly but with concentrated bitterness and then sat down and began to take off her gloves with that exaggerated show of composure which is a sign in some people of suppressed emotion
i wonder it was angelica who went inside mrs orton beg exclaimed well that was what her mother said lord dawne replied and both her parents seem to think
i shall decline to live with him evadne repeated with emphasis mrs orton beg slowly resumed her reclining position acting as one does who has heard the worst and realizes that there is nothing to be done but to recover from the shock
the expression of her face was so different that they were really less alike than they had been when evadne was four years younger evadne's disposition it must be remembered was essentially swift to act
know mrs orton beg answered with interest what was it well you know the dean's brother has a large family of daughters
and there entered a grave distinguished looking man between thirty and forty years of age apparently with black hair and deep blue eyes at once penetrating and winning in expression misses ortonbeg greeted him with pleasure
her face was pale but her eyes were bright and the pupils were dilated i have come to claim your hospitality auntie she pursued
but they don't return from town till tomorrow they have all been assisting at the marriage of a niece of yours i hear and the heavenly twins have been prolonging the festivities on their own account adeline wrote to me in despair
i fell in love and liked the sensation and gave myself up to it unreservedly certainly i was a fool there is no other word for it
when the bright sunshine and beauty of all things only to make my own barren life look all the more bare in its loneliness when my soul struggles to free itself from the shackles of the flesh
my sister flatters herself that i have some influence with the children and as it is quite certain that nobody else has i am careful not to dispel the illusion it is a comfort to her but the twins will not allow me to deceive myself upon that head
prepared to do her best to dissuade her but then again she relapsed giving in to a doubt of her own capacity to advise in such an emergency accompanied by a sudden and involuntary feeling of respect for evadne's principles however peculiar and unprecedented they might be
when all at once without hearing anything she became conscious of a presence near her and looking up she was startled to see evadne herself
and let me walk into the title then i'd give angelica the hamilton house property and it would be very jolly for all of us but look here
and by crook which she defines as circumventing the slave drivers of her sex a task which she seems to think can easily be accomplished by finessing and what was last thing mrs orton beg inquired smiling indulgently
opinions are germs in the moral atmosphere which fasten themselves upon us if we are predisposed to entertain them but some states of feeling are a perfume
the imposition upon a girl's innocence and inexperience of a disreputable man for a husband mrs orton beg was startled by this bold assertion which was so unprecedented in her experience that for a moment she could not utter a word
to keep it filled for ever with holy and beautiful thoughts when i am alone i listen for the chime and when i have repeated it to myself slowly
i don't understand you in the least evadne mrs orton beg replied your husband was a good man evadne answered indirectly
and at any rate girls do talk in that way sometimes not really meaning it i thought it was mere youngness on our part and theory i don't know now whether i quite approve of your having been told of this new departure
i thought you loved him she ventured after a prolonged pause yes so did i evadne answered frowning
he drove off full tilt oh dear poor lady adeline mrs beale exclaimed lord dawne smiled again and changed the subject
with something of hope whereon the weary mind might repose
misses ortonbeg knew in her head that the reason and right were on evadne's side but she felt in her heart the full force of the custom and prejudice that would be against her
knowledge cries to us in vain as a rule before experience has taken the sharp edge off our egotism by experience i mean the addition of some personal feeling to our knowledge
but are you married evadne mrs orton beg asked in a voice rendered unnatural by the rapid beating of her heart let me tell you auntie all about it
evadne answered hoarsely she drew her chair a little closer to the fire and spread her hands out to the blaze there was no other light in the room by this time the wind without howled dismally still
but there is often an element of surprise in the confirmation of our shrewdest suspicions and now she sat upon leant forward and looked at her niece aghast what she demanded
it seemed to be listening to be waiting and evadne waited and listened too raising her head there was a perceptible momentary pause then came the chime full round
i must have a double said miss winstanley lightly but it was you the child insisted i saw you quite well flowers and all
her friends were chiefly of her own way of thinking but her faith was so profound and the charm of her conversation so entrancing
with mrs orton beg it was different her spiritual nature predominated her habits of mind were dreamy she lived for life to come entirely and held herself in constant communion with another world
she added indicating the letter i do said evadne decidedly i would stop the imposition approved of custom convinced at by parents made possible by the state of ignorance in which we are carefully kept
with each note as it floated forth filling the silent spaces and then she awoke with a start to thought once more and knew that she had been a long long time alone she was going to ring but at that moment a servant entered and announced
she felt it near her she said she believed that its inhabitants visit the earth and take cognizance of all we do and suffer
she would a as human being have her periods of strong feeling but that was merely a physical condition in no way affecting her character and the only healthy minded happy state for her was the one in which thought instantly translated itself into action
and then diavolo lost his temper and pulled her hair and she got hold of his and dragged him out of the room by his my presence of course counted for nothing and the next i saw of them they were in their ponies in a secluded grassy glade of the forest
that the hardest headed materialists were apt to feel strange delicious thrills in her presence forebodings of possibilities beyond the test of reason and knowledge
and i have come to see if i can be of any use my sister he added turning to mrs beale with his bright almost boyish smile which was like his nephew diavolo's and made them both irresistible
and here again the family likeness between aunt and niece was curiously apparent both masked their agitation because both by temperament were shy and ashamed to show strong feeling evadne looked into the fire for a little
these ancient lines of shingle are exactly similar to the present beaches in most bays and they often attain an elevation of forty or fifty feet above the present level
no crossbreeds would ever have been produced much less those prolific races which we now recognize as distinct species
in these cases however it may be observed that there was always one parent at least of pure breed and no proof was obtained that a true hybrid race could be perpetuated
from the above considerations it appears that species have a real existence in nature and that each was endowed at the time of its creation with the attributes and organization by which it is now distinguished
the diminution in the perpendicular thickness of the deposit is lessened in a much greater decreasing ratio that in the straightened valley of central and upper egypt owing to the great extent east and west over which the inundation spreads
the dead bodies of the larger cetacea are sometimes found floating on the surface of the waters as was the case with the immense whale exhibited in london in eighteen thirty-one and the carcass of a sea-cow or lamantine
deltas of inland seas having thus briefly considered some of the lacustrine deltas now in progress we may next turn our attention to those of inland seas
so that the lead cannot be drawn off without some vertebra being attached this bone bed as it was called by our surveyors is three miles and a half in length and forty-five fathoms under water and contains a few shells intermingled with the bones
which measured seventy feet came ashore near peterhead in sixteen eighty-two many individuals of the genus balnoptera have met the same fate it will be sufficient to refer to those cast on shore near burnt island
the antennae at the end of which are fine pencils of hair are the principal organs for swimming and are moved with great rapidity the animal resides within two small valves not unlike those of a bivalve shell and moults its integuments annually
which intervenes between the rosetta and damietta branches is usually called the delta the coast line of which is about ninety miles in length
while others were inclined to magnify extravagantly the superiority of his intellect because the vertical height of his skull is so great when compared to its horizontal length
in thus providing for their own progeny these insects assist materially the process of fructification few persons need be reminded
this increase of elevation in perpendicular height is much smaller in lower than in upper egypt and in the delta it diminishes still more so that according to an approximate calculation the land about elephantine
proceeding from some accidental cause or rather to speak more philosophically from some general law not yet understood but which may not be permitted permanently to interfere with those laws of generation by which species may in general
but in a wild state it would not have precisely the same wants either as the horse or the ass and if in consequence of some difference of this kind it strayed from the herd it would soon be hunted down by beasts of prey and destroyed
different races of men are all of one species it would be relevant to our subject if we were to enter into a farther discussion on these topics because even if a graduated scale of organization and intelligence could have been established
the solen and the cardium for example which are usually found in shallow water near the shore pierce through a soft bottom without injury to their shells and the pholas can drill a cavity through mud of considerable hardness
hunter's opinion the celebrated john hunter has observed that the true distinction of species must ultimately be gathered from their incapacity of propagating with each other and producing offspring capable of again continuing itself
we may state therefore that the new strata annually produced are thrown down upon a slope about two miles in length so that notwithstanding the great depth of the lake
some anatomists being disposed to deny the quadruped the intelligence which he really possesses because they found that the volume of his brain was small in comparison to that of the other mammalia
the species of these and many other tribes can sink when alarmed with considerable rapidity often to the depth of several feet and can also penetrate upwards again to the surface
if we take some genus of insects such as the bee we find that each of the numerous species have some difference in its habits its mode of collecting honey
the changes gradually effected in the great plain of northern italy since the time of the roman republic are considerable extensive lakes and marshes have been gradually filled up as those near placentia parma and cremona
in regard however to the distribution of inorganic matter the deposits of lakes and seas are formed under very analogous circumstances
for at a considerable distance from the present shores parallel lines of rolled stones and shells are seen rising one above the other like the seats of an amphitheatre
and in regard to other classes of organic remains there must be the closest analogy as i shall endeavor more fully to explain when speaking of the imbedding of plants and animals in recent deposits
or in the neighborhood of paris and many other countries imbedding of freshwater species in estuary and marine deposits
so as to insure the preservation of the intermediate race the common mule when obtained by human art may be protected by the power of man
several old lines of towers and seamarks occur at different distances from the present coast all indicating the successive retreat of the sea for each line has in its turn become useless to mariners
imbedding of the remains of marine plants and animals marine plants the large banks of drift seaweed which occur on each side of the equator in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans were before alluded to
and the primary and volcanic mountains of central france and when at length it enters the mediterranean it discolors the blue waters of that sea with a whitish sediment for the distance of between six and seven miles throughout which space the current of fresh water is perceptible
the new deposits are inclined at so slight an angle that the dip of the beds would be termed in ordinary geological language horizontal
an admission fatal to the idea of its being a general law of nature that a few original types only should be formed and that all intermediate races should spring from the intermixture of those stocks
resemble the tertiary argillaceous and calcareous marls of lacustrine origin in central france in both cases many of the genera of shells most abundant as limnea and planorbis are the same
and on the advance of the delta they continued to flow out through the new deposits among the more direct proofs of the increase of land we find that mese described under the appellation of mesua collis by pomponius mela
when the snows melt the volume and velocity of the river are greatest and large quantities of sand mud vegetable matter and driftwood are introduced
should the fact be hereafter ascertained that two mules can propagate their kind we must still inquire whether the offspring may not be regarded in the light of a monstrous birth
they are stranded thus a narwal monodon monoceros was found on the beach near boston in lincolnshire in the year eighteen hundred the whole of its body buried in the mud
although they were well acquainted with those of aix and others are still more distant and attached great importance to them as they invariably did to all hot springs the waters of balaruc therefore must have formerly issued under the sea a common phenomenon on the borders of the mediterranean
and at alloa recorded by sibbald and neill the other individual mentioned by sibbald as having come ashore at boyne in banffshire was probably reserbek
and many have been drained naturally by the deepening of the beds of rivers deserted river courses are not unfrequent as that of the serio morto which formerly fell into the adda in lombardy
analogous formations are in progress in the submarine tracts extending from the shetland isles to the north of ireland wherever soundings can be procured
in the time of the romans the hot baths of monfalcone were on one of several islands of alpine limestone between which and the mainland on the north was a channel of the sea about a mile broad
is a mere visionary speculation it has been found necessary to exaggerate the sagacity of the ape tribe at the expense of the dog and strange contradictions have arisen in the conclusions deduced from the structure of the elephant
he was unwilling however to admit that the horse and the ass were of the same species because some rare instances had been adduced of the breeding of mules although he maintained that the wolf the dog and the jackal
be prevented from becoming blended if for example we discovered that the progeny of a mule race degenerated greatly in the first generation in force sagacity or any attributes necessary for its preservation in a state of nature we might infer
some naturalists considering them as affording the strongest of all proofs in favor of the reality of species others on the contrary
and that a scale might be traced from apes with foreheads villanous low to the african variety of the human species and from that to the european
the bed of the river itself says sir j g wilkinson undergoes a gradual increase of elevation varying in different places and always lessening in proportion as the river approaches the sea
which in the character of its leaves and flowers approached most nearly to the garden onion but had the elongated bulbous root and smell of the leek
course of the po the po affords an instructive example of the manner in which a great river bears down to the sea the matter poured into it by a multitude of tributaries descending from lofty chains of mountains
the po also itself has often deviated from its course having after the year thirteen ninety deserted part of the territory of cremona and invaded that of parma its old channel being still recognizable and bearing the name of po monto
the signs of a much greater depression anterior to the historical period have also been brought to light by an artesian well bored in eighteen forty-seven to the depth of more than four hundred feet which still failed to penetrate through the modern fluviatile deposit
imbedding of cetacea it is not uncommon for the larger cetacea which can float only in a considerable depth of water to be carried during storms or high tides into estuaries or upon low shores where upon the retiring of high water
a fisherman going to his boat saw the horn and tried to pull it out when the animal began to stir itself an individual of the common whale balna mysticetus
i observed along the borders of several freshwater lakes in the state of new york a luxuriant crop of this plant in clear water of moderate depth
these stigmas became impregnated by pollen blown from some other adjacent plants of the same species but had they been of different species and not too remote in their organization mule races must have resulted
by the confluence of the rhone and the currents of the mediterranean driven by winds from the south sandbars are often formed across the mouths of the river
appealing to them as countenancing the opposite doctrine that all the varieties of organization and instinct now exhibited in the animal and vegetable kingdoms may have been propagated from a small number of original types
the supposed original depth of the head of lake and nearly two miles in length inclined at a very slight angle in the meantime a great number of small deltas are growing around the borders of the lake at the mouths of rapid torrent
in the british seas the shells and other organic remains lie in soft mud or loose sand and gravel whereas in the bed of the adriatic donati found them frequently enclosed in stone of recent origin
every delta and sand-bar thus acquires solidity which often prevents streams from forcing their way through them so that their mouths are constantly changing their position
which may be well conceived when we state that the tower of tignaux erected on the shore so late as the year seventeen thirty-seven is already a mile remote from it
the recent strata of lacustrine origin above alluded to are of very small extent but analogous deposits on the grandest scale are forming in the great canadian lakes as in lakes superior and huron
and at a low facial angle is frequently accompanied with inferiority of mental powers is certain but the attempt to trace a gradual scale of intelligence through the different species of animals accompanying the modifications of the form of the skull
recapitulation for the reasons therefore detailed in this and the two preceding chapters we may draw the following inferences in regard to the reality of species in nature
some wallflowers and pinks had been growing in a garden in a dry sunny situation and their stigmas had been ripened so as to be moist and to absorb pollen with avidity although their anthers were not yet developed
when indeed we consider how busily some insects have been shown to be engaged in conveying anther dust from flower to flower
for this reason the alluvial deposit does not cause the delta to protrude rapidly into the sea although some ancient cities are now a mile or more inland
some speculators were bold enough to affirm that certain simi or apes differed as little from the more savage races of men as those do from the human race in general
and stated by him to be nearly an island is now far inland notre-dame du port also was a harbor in eighteen ninety-eight but is now a league from the shore psalmodi was an island in eight fifteen and is now two leagues from the sea
in regard moreover to the permanent propagation of hybrid races among animals insuperable difficulties present themselves when we endeavor to conceive the blending together of the different instincts and properties of two species
from a line drawn from st gingoulph to vevey gives a mean depth of somewhat less than six hundred feet and from that part of the rhone the fluviatile mud is always found along the bottom
hold abundance of carbonate of lime in solution and precipitate travertine or sometimes bind together the sand and gravel into solid sandstones and conglomerates
were all of one species because he had found by two experiments that the dog would breed both with the wolf and the jackal and that the mule in each case would breed again with the dog
after adducing various arguments to show that neither of these causes can explain the permanent diversity of plants indigenous in different regions he says in regard to the crossing of races
near the northern borders of the basin the isonzo tagliamento and many other streams are forming immense beds of sand and some conglomerate for here some high mountains of alpine limestone approach within a few miles of the sea
the integument is composed of five spiral valves of a quadrangular form in chara hispida which abounds in the lakes of for fisha
the strata probably consist of alternation of finer and coarser particles for during the hotter months from april to august
that the varieties of plants arrange themselves under two general heads those produced by external circumstances and those formed by hybridity
where beds of sand and clay are seen inclosing shells of existing species the chara also plays the same part in the subaqueous vegetation of north america as in europe
why they are almost entirely wanting in our own country i have already adverted to the eight regions of different depths in the aegean sea
but which lends no support whatever to the notion of a gradual transmutation of one species into another least of all of the passage in the course of many generations from an animal of a more simple to one of a more complex structure
as inhabits the land or the waters of a river or a lake whereas in the other case there will be an admixture and most frequently a predominance of animals which inhabits the salt water
the same botanist remarks that vegetable hybrids when not strictly intermediate more frequently approach the female than the male parent species but they never exhibit characters foreign to both
that since the time of the romans there has been a general subsidence of the coast and bed of this sea in the same region to the amount of five feet so that the advance of the new-made land has not been so fast as it would have been had the level of the coast remained unaltered
which the conchiferous mollusks do not the cast off shells resembling thin scales and occurring in countless myriads in many ancient freshwater marls imparts to them a divisional structure like that so frequently derived from plates of mica
if then we could obtain a section of the accumulation formed in the last eight centuries we should see a great series of strata probably from six hundred to nine hundred feet thick
as compared to marine for in the latter as is seen on sea beaches coral reefs or in the bottom of the seas examined by dredging wherever the individual shells are exceedingly numerous there rarely fails to be a vast variety of species
this channel is now converted into a grassy plain which surrounds the islands on all sides among the numerous changes on this coast we find that the present channel of the isonzo is several miles to the west of its ancient bed in part of which at ronchi
a fact of which i believe no examples are yet recorded either in regard to mixtures of the horse and ass or any other of the mammalia
rendering the bottom as verdant as a grassy meadow here therefore we may expect some of the tough seed vessels to be preserved in mud just as we detect them fossil in the eocene strata of hampshire
much pleasure is to be derived from seeing what old words grew together and made new ones what syllables or letters got lopped off or twisted how silent letters became silent and why from what older language is planted
those stories i feel quite glad for the sake of those who are not able to want better that such gratification is not denied them i would not wish to frown the silly story out of existence so long as it is a veritable expression of many people's need

i would not discourage any comrade of mine in the social struggle but sometimes it is a wholesome thing to reconsider our size a word in defense of the silly story

the majority of lightly thinking fairly read people who make use of the word literature rather easily do so with a very indistinct idea of its content to them it usually means a certain limited form of human  expression chiefly works of the imagination poetry drama the various forms of the novel

redeemers and miracles in their various altered habitats no one can so thoroughly appreciate what is in the face of a man turned upward in prayer as who has followed the evolution of the black monster op to that impersonal conception of god
and then turn to the record of those pathetic strivings of the frightened child with some tenderness  sym some solemn curiosity to know what men were able to think and feel when they led their lives as in a threatening wonder house where everything was an unknown investing  in crouching hostility
the people of the most highly evolved scientific and mechanical age taking especial delight in psychic abnormalities and morbidities whereby the most utterly unreasonable fictive creation becomes the greatest center of curiosity and attraction to the children of reason

bishop wilfred being driven from his bishopric by king everth two bishops were consecrated in his stead when we read these we have not any very adequate conception of what the anglo-saxon people were doing
no author is to be considered worthy of a place unless his works can be at least twisted to fit this conception with some slight refinement of idea in so far as it recognizes the obscurer recesses of the mind as entitled to representation as well as the externals
you will find that the mitigating influence of civilization knowledge moderation creeping into expression produces flat neutral diluted sounds watery words so to speak long-drawn out and glidingly inoffensive
and if you look into the still waters of some summer pool or mountain rain cup the image there almost as sharp lined as that in your polished glass except for the vague tremor that seems to move under the water rather than on its surface and suggest an ethereal something missing in the drawing room shadow

while his knowledge of facts was yet so extreme if limited as hardly to be worth while writing in books about none of the appearances of the man's soul is more interesting than that reflected in the continuous succession of philosophies he has poured out let him who reads them read them always twice first simply to know and grasp what is said
any such a reader i say must find among its most attractive pages the stories of early superstitions the fictions of fear the struggles of the race childs intelligence with overlooming problems
for it was not right in its creation ancient literature addressed itself to the ear always while modern literature speaks to the eye if once you can get your ears washing with the sounds of the old language as with the washing of the seas when you sit on the beach
and it becomes evident that love and winsomeness are usurping the kingdom of power and fear through all we are compelled to observe one constant tendency of the human mind
you will naturally pose yourself the question why is it that the bare sounds of these old stories are so much more vibrating drum-like shrilling at times than any modern song
this coldness and quietness sound the doom of poetry a people which shall be fully permeated with the spirit and word of science will never conceive great poems
and they allow other modes to have been literature in the past as a sort of kindly concession to the past a blanket indulgence to its unevolved state at present however no indulgences are allowed whatever is not the mode is

when you are ready for such rereading then be as critical as you please which does not necessarily mean be condemnatory it means rather take notice of all generals and particulars and question them
there are those who have only learned the art of reading at all because of the foolish story and quite in a side way i learned the other day through the grave assertion of a physician that the ability to read even these whereby some little refinement of conception is introduced into the idea of love is one of the restraining influences upon sexual degradation
who desires to read not merely for the absorption of the moment but for the sake of permanent impression who wishes to have an idea of man not only as he is now but through the whole articulate record of his existence who would know the thoughts of his infancy and the connected course of his development
it is not literature at all when confronted by the very great names of the past which they neither consign to oblivion nor patronize by toleration for their undeveloped condition names which are names for all ages

it is in fact this imaginative faculty which has forerun the accomplishments of science and while under the influence of practical experiment and the extension of knowledge such dreams have passed away this much remains and will long long remain in humankind covered over and shamefacedly concealed as much as may be
in so considering it let it be understood that i speak of no particular form of literature but the entire body of a people's expressed thought preserved either traditionally in writing or in print
i would recommend them both to be used the first way is to read yourself backward into it as much as possible do not be a critic on first reading put the critic asleep let yourself seem to believe it as did the people who wrote it read it aloud
a mirror maze is literature wherein man sees all faces of himself lengthened here widened there distorted in another place restored again to due proportion
and cutha of cymric it reads considerably like a stockraiser's pedigree book the trouble is we have no particular notion of cymric probably if we went back we should find he was the son of somebody but at any rate he had a grandson and the grandson was a king

till there arose all the beauty of fairy tales and shiny myths and singing legends now anyone who desires to see in literature the most that there is in it
you will find that half the beauty and the farce of old-time legend lies in the bare sound of it far far more is it dependent on the voice than any modern writings are and surely the reason is simple enough
if you are where you will not annoy anybody let the words sing themselves over your lips and let they sung themselves over the lips of people who were dead so long ago
but i wish now to maintain that some very lowly forms of written expression must be included in literature always remembering that i am seeking the complete composite of man's soul here then i include in literature beside what i have spoken on not only in standard novels and stories and sketches and travels and magazine essays of all sorts
and compelled by the nature of his own activity to try to find an explanation to them think that most of us if we were not the inheritor of the ages that have passed since then should be staggered and out breathed even now by all these lights and forms through which we move
common among poor and ignorant young women the face of man revealed in them is therefore not altogether without charm though it may look foolish to us i said there were some appearances in the mirror not generally remarked

i mean the literatures of philosophy and science philosophy is simply the coordination of the sciences the formulation of the general and related principles deduced from the collection of orderly arrangement of the facts of existence yet man had rich literatures in philosophy

it is a nebulous body revolving in an elliptical orbit of great elongation love love love will not be the wound of cupid but the manifestation of universal reproductive instincts
but which to me are suggestive one of these is the evident delight of the human soul in smut in the older literature these things are either badly set down as law and cursing as occasionally in the bible or they are clothed and mixed with sprightly imaginations as in the tales of boccaccio
hope desire thought all that battled through the living figures turned to dust and ashes long ago train your ears to hear the song of it it helps to feel what the writer felt and after that read critically with one eye on the page so to speak

is this one beating or several in any of these cases it may be one perhaps as to some purposes and several as to others these examples are given
in respect of the consequences of the modified act or offense in the way of conjunct influence lastly whatever circumstances can be seen to be connected with the consequences of the offense
that men may be aware of the ambiguity of language and neither harass themselves with unsolvable doubts nor one another with interminable disputes
now materiality is a relative term applied to the consequences of an act it bore relation to pain and pleasure applied to the
sixteen in the third place acts may be distinguished into transient and continued thus to strike is a transient act to lean a continued one to buy a transient act to keep in one's possession a continued one
seventeen use strictness of speech there is a difference between a continued act and a repetition of acts it is a repetition of acts when there are intervals filled up by acts of different natures
whatsoever take any act whatsoever there is nothing in the nature of things that excludes any imaginable object from being a circumstance to it
in the way of derivation when it is of the number of the events to the production of which that in question has been contributory in the way of collateral connexion
in the crown of the hat were found scraps of paper with sentences expressive of the purpose he was come upon here then suppose the event in question is the wound received by buckingham
eighteen there is a difference again between a repetition of acts and a habit or practice the term repetition of acts may be employed let the acts in question be separated by ever such short intervals
other circumstances again entering into combination with the act and the former set of circumstances are productive of still farther consequences these additional consequences if they are of the beneficial kind
it is only a very small number that can be discovered by the utmost exertion of the human faculties it is a still smaller number that ever actually do attract our notice
were intention out of the question but such also as depend upon the connection there may be between these first mentioned consequences and the intention
as where a man runs against you or throws water in your face acts may be called intransitive when the motion is communicated to no other body on which the
act to intend to strike an internal or exterior one twelve acts of discourse are a sort of mixture of the two external acts which are no ways material nor attended
with any consequences any farther than as they serve to express the existence of internal ones to speak to another to strike to write to him to strike to make signs to him to strike are all so many acts of discourse
the criminative are connected with the consequences of the original offense in the way of production with the act and with one another in the way of conjunct influence the consequences of the original offense with them
twenty-three we have already had occasion to make mention for a moment of the consequences of an act these were distinguished into material and immaterial in like manner may the circumstances of it be distinguished
acts of the body by internal mental acts acts of the mind thus to strike is an external or exterior footnote an exterior act is also called by lawyers overt end of footnote
felton's drawing out his knife his making his way into the chamber his going down to portsmouth his conceiving an indignation at the idea of buckingham's administration that administration itself
and let the sum total of them occupy ever so short a space of time the term habit is not employed but when the acts in question are supposed to be separated by long-continued intervals
in the way also of derivation these different sets of circumstances with the consequences of the modified act or offense in the way of production and with one another
when they imported the negation of such or such a particular mode of agency for instance not to strike such a person or such a thing or in such a direction ten

that is distinguishable from the former it may be said to be in its termination as soon as it has been applied to any other part of the same person
whether directly in the way of derivation or obliquely in the way of collateral affinity to wit in virtue of its being connected in the way of derivation with some of the circumstances with which they stand connected in the same manner
which though numerous and heterogeneous derive a sort of unity from the relation they bear to some common design or end such as the act of giving a dinner the act of maintaining a child the act of exhibiting a triumph
one the business of government is to promote the happiness of the society by punishing and rewarding that part of its business which consists in punishing is more particularly the subject of penal law
these we shall have occasion to distinguish hereafter by the name of criminative circumstances full note c b one title korean circumstances in the foot note
and with the act respectively in the way of derivation the consequences of the modified offense with the criminative exculpative and extenuative circumstances respectively
nine such acts again as are negative may either be absolutely so or relatively absolutely when they import the negation of all positive agency whatsoever for instance not to strike at all relatively
together with this act under the notion of the same offense are included certain circumstances which circumstances enter into the essence of the offense contribute by their conjunct influence
false consciousness where he believes or imagines certain circumstances to subsist which in truth do not subsist
a continued act when there are no such intervals thus to lean is continued act to keep striking a repetition of acts
twenty-one so much with regard to acts considered in themselves we come now to speak of the circumstances with which they may have been accompanied
not to strike on a certain occasion a negative one positive acts are styled also acts of commission negative
of acts with their particular circumstances with which we shall have to do in the body of the work an act of some sort or other is necessarily included in the notion of every offense
and the sum total of them to occupy a considerable space of time it is not for instance the drinking ever so many times nor ever so much at a time in the course of the same sitting that it will constitute a habit of drunkenness
nor therefore that it should have any related to it in the way of conjunct influence but of the circumstances of all kinds which actually do attach upon an event
must have some circumstance or other and in truth an indefinite multitude of circumstances related to it in the way of production
to the production of its consequences and in conjunction with the act are brought into view by the name by which it stands distinguished
which really do subsist unconsciousness when he fails of perceiving certain circumstances to subsist which however do subsist
eight acts may be distinguished in several ways for several purposes they may be distinguished in the first place into positive and negative
where the circumstance in question and the event in question without being either of them instrumental in the production of the other are related each of them to some common object which has been concerned in the production of them both
an example may be of use in the year sixteen twenty eight villiers duke of buckingham favourited and the minister of a charles the first of england received a wound and died the man who gave it him was one felton
it can never be known whether it is beneficial or indifferent or mischievous in some circumstances even to kill a man may be a beneficial act in others to set food before him may be a pernicious one
these questions it is now evident may frequently be answered with equal propriety in opposite ways and if there be any occasions on which they can be answered only in one way the answer will depend upon the nature of the occasion
the perceptive faculty is susceptible of three states consciousness unconsciousness and false consciousness consciousness when the party believes precisely those circumstances and no others to subsist
of the consequences of any act the multitude and the variety must needs be infinite but such of them only as are material are worth regarding
fifth acts may be distinguished into simple and complex simple such as the act of striking the act of leaning or the act of drinking above instanced complex consisting each of a multitude of simple acts
and again at eight minutes after twelve is it one beating or several you beat one man and instantly in the same breath you beat another
the act of bearing arms the act of holding a court and so forth twenty it has been every now and then made a question what it is in such a case that constitutes one act where one act has ended and another act has begun
the general tendency of an act is more or less pernicious according to the sum total of its consequences that is according to the difference between the sum of such as are good and the sum of such as are evil
inasmuch as they contributed in common to the event of buckingham's receiving the wound by preventing him from putting himself upon his guard upon the first appearance of the intruder
eleven in the second place acts may be distinguished into external and internal by external are meant corporal acts
to express it an act which is positive in its nature may be characterized by a negative expression thus not to be at rest is as much as to say to move so also an act which is negative in its nature may be characterized by a positive expression
thus where a man poisons himself while he is lifting up the poison to his mouth the act is in its commencement
for it is also to be observed that into the account of the consequences of the act are to be taken not such only as might have ensued
in proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious will be the demand it creates for punishment what happiness consists of we have already seen enjoyment of pleasures security from pains two
bear a material relation to the offense in the way of evidence they may accordingly be styled evidentiary circumstances and may become of use by being held forth upon occasion
now among the consequences of an act be they what they may such only by one who views them in the capacity of a legislator can be said to be material
three it is to be observed that here as well as henceforward wherever consequences are spoken of such only are meant as are material
is the act be the motion of a body which is separated from the person of the agent before it reaches the object it may be said during that interval to be in its intermediate progress full note or in this migration or in transtitude
charles's appointing such a minister and so on higher and higher without end are so many circumstances related to the event of buckingham's receiving the wound
and a footnote twenty-six these several relations do not all of them attach upon an event with equal certainty in the first place it is plain indeed that every event
circumstances it bears relation to the consequences a circumstance may be said to be material when it bears a visible relation in point of causality to the consequences immaterial when it bears no such visible relation
on which the effects of it can be material it may be said to be in its termination or to be in the last stage of its progress as soon as the motion or impulse has been communicated to some such foreign body
to motion an act indivisible with regard to matter is the motion or rest of one single atom of matter an act indivisible with regard to motion is the motion of any body from one single atom of space to the next to it
it is necessary that such sittings themselves be frequently repeated every habit is a repetition of acts or to speak more strictly when a man has frequently repeated such and such acts after considerable intervals he is said to have
the effects of it are regarded as material than some part of the same person in whom it originated as where a man runs or washes himself
seven there are also two other articles on which the general tendency of an act depends and on that as well as on other accounts
who exasperated at the maladministration of which that minister was accused went down from london to portsmouth where buckingham happened then to be made his way into his antechamber and finding him busily
nineteen force acts may be distinguished into indivisible and divisible indivisible acts are merely imaginary they may be easily conceived but can never be known to be exemplified such as are divisible may be so with regard either to matter or to
it may be said to be in the middle or intermediate stage or stages of its progress while the motion having passed from the person of the agent
bestow according to the value they bear in that capacity upon the circumstances to which they owe their birth the appellation of exculpative
in the way of causation or production the bloodiness of the knife a circumstance related to the same event in the way of derivation
an act of the intransitive kind may be said to be in its commencement when the motion or impulse is as yet confined to the member or organ in which it originated and has not yet been communicated to any member or organ
by positive are meant such as consist in motion or exertion by negative such as consist in keeping at rest that is in forbearing to move or exert oneself in such and such circumstances thus to strike is a positive act
it must of course have a still greater multitude of circumstances related to it in the way of collateral connexion but it does not appear necessary that every event should have circumstances related to it in the way of derivation
and the purpose for which the question is proposed a man is wounded in two fingers at one stroke is it one wound or several a man is beaten at twelve o'clock
it is to be observed that the nature of the act whether positive or negative is not to be determined immediately by the form of the discourse made use of
were circumstances related to the circumstances of felton's making his way into the room going down to portsmouth and so forth in the way of conjunct influence
these powerful agents working year after year cause vast and important changes to occur in the formation of mountains and valleys so great is the power of frost that it has frequently been utilised in blasting
jack frost is a finished artist i assure you and his etchings are dainty and attractive beyond words if you have entered an unlighted room and seen the moonlight filtering palely through a frost etched window then you know its charm
formations which sometimes resemble fine coral branches as soon as the water film ice crystallisations are completed they are closely followed by the true frost crystals which form upon the various dry places upon the glass
how he tweaks and nips exposed ears and noses and how they tingle and ache because of his stinging caress jack frost we read is the very personification of frost and cold
again an ominous cracking as loud as a rifle report comes from the still ice-covered pond it is merely jack frost indulging in a bit of rifle practice
after this has been allowed to dissolve gradually you will observe a thin water film or formation which has been left upon the outer edge of the glass the centre of which will be clear do not disturb this film for it is in part from this that the frost crystallisations form and develop
in zero weather in mid-winter when the earth is frozen to a great depth below the surface when in driving over the unpaved country roads they give forth a hard metallic road
for with all his mischief-making he finds abundant opportunity to work out and display much really fine artistic ability in his choice etchings and decorative schemes
classified there are about ten distinct types of the windowpane frost representatives of each and all types never appear at any given time upon one window and strangely enough the designs are never precisely alike on any two panes of glass
but rather draws away from their immediate vicinity this strange habit of the granular frost is well shown in the photographed illustration where it will be observed that the granular frost acts merely as a background or sky effect for the real frost pictures as in a painting
also in the arrangement of minute invisible scratches and the accumulation of dust particles which collect from day to day all of which affect the arrangement and collection of the frost crystals it has been observed that double windows and furnace heated apartments are not favourable to frost formations
marvellous indeed is the variety and detail displayed in these attractive windowpane etchings furnished by the frost spirit and if one is housed some day in midwinter zero weather one may watch the entire growth and development of these exquisite frost etchings from start to finish
upon a still moonlit night when jack frost is astir if you chance to be out of doors especially in the open country you will be made aware of his presence in many ways besides the tingling of your ears suddenly a sharp mysterious report will occur in the forest and a great tree trunk is cleft mysteriously in twain
as soon as you move the lamp away from the glass the pictures instantly begin to grow and develop delicate feathery etchings of ice crystals first appearing around the outer edge of the water film and according to the temperature of the room form rapidly or slowly
then indeed we may be fully assured that nature has utterly succumbed to the advances of the frost king and that jack frost himself has arrived in earnest
the white fern-like type is raised from the glass and was formed in a very cold room where it slowly developed and grew for days number thirty-nine as another striking arrangement of the two types observe the very delicate fleecy patterns of the frost which forms a background for the fern-like scrolls
but with infinite patience as soon as it is twilight the following night the frost spirit steals forth again and restores once more his magic fantastic pictures by the rays of the wintry moonlight
jack frost as the great frost spirit is familiarly known the world over is a most important if rather mythical personage and very few of us are really familiar with the works which he creates in his more serious moods and the really wonderful methods which he displays
when the trees are all stripped of their coverings with the exception of a few forlorn brown leaves which cling tenaciously to the skeleton branches which crack and sway in the chilly blasts
the heavy frosts are a recognized and most important factor in creating remarkable changes in rocky formations of the earth's surface large masses of rock are constantly being split and reconstructed by its mighty blasting powers
to do this place a lamp or candle before a frost-covered window in a cold room or unheated by furnace of course not near enough to the glass to crack it but just close enough to melt the heavy frost curtain which may have formed previously upon the glass
number forty shows a perfectly developed fern while in number forty-one we have a strikingly beautiful example of a group of ferns this type is heavily laid upon the glass and develops in zero weather
who has simply paused to caress them with his icy breath in passing and lo they are beautiful later when the morning sun touches them they all like cinderella are shorn of their finery and become as before just mere commonplace brown and withered seed pods again
and great sections of solid material are converted in the same manner into soil by the secret action of the frost which works continually with the other elements of heat and water to effect these changes
the night time seems to be most favourable for the finest efforts of jack frost usually in midwinter or early spring he prefers to select a still cold night zero weather for his best out-of-door display
how it glittered and sparkled the delicate frostwork you were attracted no doubt and marvelled at the dainty tracings but few of us have really had an opportunity to study the detail of these frost designs minutely or have considered that there were more than three or four designs at most
but it is usually in the coldest winter weather that he applies his very choicest designs upon the glass of our windows and just how charming and interesting they are you may judge by the photographed designs herein showing
when water being poured into the crevice of a great rock and allowed to freeze the rock was readily split as desired all vegetation succumbs readily to the withering blight of the frost with the exception of the evergreen varieties
of all the pranks in which jack frost indulges his wholesale destruction of the beautiful flowers and plants is the greatest to be deplored but with all the marvellous works of the mighty frost spirit nothing is quite so fascinating and interesting as the curious phenomena or frost formations which he creates and deposits upon the window-panes in mid-winter
all of us are more or less familiar with the mischievous pranks of jack frost and they are quite separate and apart from those of the gentle white hoar frost which is frequently seen early in autumn upon the first still cool mornings
the beautiful frost studies illustrating this chapter were photographed in northern vermont where the winters are long and the cold very intense affording the best opportunities possible for the development and study of the frost etchings these studies are of course somewhat magnified yet you will have no difficulty in recognizing many familiar frost designs
exquisite tracings and fern-like leaves shoot out as by magic toward the centre of the glass but as soon as they reach a dry place upon the glass they instantly cease if you observe very closely you will discover that meanwhile in the little open spaces between the bolder fern-like designs more delicate feathery forms are gradually appearing
the cause for this is that the juices of plants naturally expand when touched by the frost and at last burst which destroys the vesicles or life of the plant which soon blackens and dies
when icicles hang by the wall and dick the shepherd blows his nail and tom bears logs into the hall and milk comes frozen home in pail shakespeare
delicate lines and stars and also in a thin dew like deposit which rapidly freezes and assumes a granular snow like form this granular frost develops very rapidly and soon covers all the unoccupied clear dry places
reduplications of any previous design are extremely rare and would only occur when a multitude of identical conditions occur this is rather singular when we consider the different factors which go to form the window-pane frost certain panes of glass vary in thickness and in surface topography
but one curious fact worthy of observation it does not intrude upon or approach near to the separate and individual designs or masterpieces of the frost already formed upon the glass
it's really a beautiful place for a home he told himself i don't wonder that farmer green likes to live near the orchard and now i'll just go over to the house and see if i can't get a peep at him and his wife and his boy johnnie and the hired man too
why yes jolly robin replied aren't these wings he asked looking down at the boards they're already spread he observed it was some minutes before jasper jay could answer him for he was laughing again but finally he managed to speak
he looked forward with much interest to the journey for as the days grew shorter he heard a great deal of talk about the trip among his elders and while he was waiting for the day when they should leave he became acquainted with many new and delicious morsels to eat
head it's one of his queer notions his and jasper jay's she explained tut tut her husband said and he chucked her under the chin and winked at his friends there was no time to say anything more for everyone was eager to start
you see the snowball hit one of the stranger's arms and to jolly's amazement the arm at once dropped off and dashed upon the ground breaking into a dozen pieces that alone was enough to startle jolly robin but the moon-faced man paid not the slightest attention to the accident
here's johnnie green jolly exclaimed he knew johnnie at once because neither farmer green nor the hired man ever went hopping and skipping about like that pretty soon jolly saw johnnie green stop and make an armful of snowballs and then he went straight toward the stranger in white though johnnie began to shout the man in white did not even turn his head
always help other people that was a motto that all the youngsters had to learn and another was this follow your father's lead later in the season in october when the robin cousins and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and all the rest of the relations made their long journey to their winter homes in the south
maybe there's a squirrel hiding behind a tree he said to himself perhaps this man in white is going to throw the stick as soon as the squirrel shows himself but no squirrel appeared and jolly robin was just about to start for the farmhouse again when he saw somebody pop out of the woodshed door and come running toward the orchard
in spite of his uneasiness jolly peeped around his tree and watched the stranger but he did not throw the stick he stood quite still and seemed to be waiting and jolly robin waited too and stared at him
however he managed to find food enough so that he continued to grow rapidly the night after he found a mountain ash on a hillside full of bright red berries his father said that he seemed much taller than he had been that morning
jasper was late too in keeping his appointment in the orchard jolly robin waited for him until almost sunset before jasper jay appeared but jolly was so glad to see jasper that he never once thought of being angry with him
to the south one thousand miles you see how simple it is jasper jay remarked with a sign-board to guide you you can't go wrong but it seemed to jolly that the new way of travelling was far more difficult than the old he said as much to jasper jay too
but nothing of the sort happened and jolly did not wait for anything more he felt that he had seen quite enough so he flew away to the shelter of the woods to find somebody to whom he could talk and tell of the strange thing that had happened in the orchard
now jolly robin had almost decided that he would never go near the orchard again but he felt that if he went with jimmy rabbit there ought not to be much danger so he agreed to jimmy's suggestion i'll be here before the morning's gone he promised
so jolly robin jumped off the bough and started through the frosty air toward the farmhouse but all at once he saw a sight that sent him darting into a tree he hid there for a while and something made him shiver something besides the cold wind
so the travelers called goodbye to jolly while he waved a farewell to them it was not many minutes before he was the only member of the robin family left in pleasant valley he felt very lonely all at once and he wanted to hurry after the others but he knew what jasper jay would say if he did
jolly found that there was a good reason for such rules if he hadn't followed his father then he might have lost his way because since it was the first time he had ever been out of pleasant valley he knew nothing whatever about travelling
come along said the blue-coated rascal follow me and you'll soon learn the new way to the south and if it isn't a good one i hope i'll never eat another beechnut jolly robin laughed he was sure then that he had nothing to worry about for everybody knew that jasper jay was specially fond of beechnuts
you must have eaten a great many of those berries said mr robin well i notice one thing jolly observed my waistcoat is fast losing its black spots and it's redder than it was the red berries certainly colored it in some way
all of jolly robin's friends and relations were greatly surprised when they saw him bidding his wife and children goodbye on the day the robin family started from pleasant valley for their winter home in the south
as soon as he had eaten his breakfast jolly went to the place where the beeches grew to find jasper jay and jasper was there just finishing his own breakfast but he was too busy he said to bother with jolly robin just then
maybe there is something queer about this case he said i'll go over to the orchard tomorrow and take a look at that headless stranger and see what i think about him if you'll meet me here we can go together
he was dressed all in white except for a battered old black hat which he wore tipped over one eye in one hand he held a stick and it seemed to jolly robin that the queer man was just about to hurl it at something
so jolly visited the mountain ash each day and fairly stuffed himself with the bright red fruit it did him no harm anyhow and he enjoyed eating it and the next spring when jolly robin returned to pleasant valley after spending the winter in the south there was not a redder waistcoat than his in all the neighborhood
while jolly robin was wondering johnnie green threw another snowball and when it struck the stranger a very peculiar thing happened and jolly robin did not laugh he was too frightened to do anything but gasp
really that was only because jolly was fast growing up but neither he nor his father stopped to think of that and since jolly had learned that motto follow your father's lead he thought his waistcoat ought to be just as red as old mr robin's was
he roamed about picking wild grapes mulberries and elderberries and he did not scorn a large green katydid when he chanced to find one there was always some new dainty to be sampled though as the weather grew colder jolly began to understand that in winter pleasant valley would not be so fine a place to live
then i shall have to fly after all jolly robin said he had expected to have a ride and naturally he was disappointed then he read the sign once more sky pond he exclaimed i don't want to go to sky pond i want to go to the south
yes jolly robin was the least bit frightened for he had caught a glimpse of a strange man it was neither farmer green nor his hired man for this was a giant he had big black eyes and a great lump of a nose which stuck out queerly from his pale moon face
when will the post begin to move jolly robin inquired a bit anxiously he had waited a whole day to begin his long journey to the south so it was only natural that he should want to start at once
with jolly robin following close behind him jasper jay flew directly to the crossroads almost halfway to the village once there he perched himself upon the signpost at the four corners and jolly robin seated himself upon one of the boards that were nailed to the post here we are said jasper jay you see how easy it is
so jolly robin fluttered over to the fence and from there he could see the signboard plainly this is what it looked like to sky pond fifteen miles there jasper jay cried when jolly had read the sign aloud you see how easy it is all you need do is to follow this road to which the hand points
anyone else would have wheeled about and chased johnnie green but this odd gentleman didn't seem to know that his hat had been knocked off that's queer said jolly robin to himself he must be asleep but i should think he would wake up
but in the morning he felt better and he welcomed the dawn with a carol that was joyous enough for anybody for this was the day when jasper jay was going to show him the new way to travel yes he too would soon be hurrying southwards where the sun was warm it was no wonder that he sang cheerily cheerup cheerily cheerup right merrily
but jolly robin followed him no longer he kept straight on and on and on and he flew so fast and so far before he stopped that he overtook the party that had started a whole day ahead of him
jasper would be sure to tell people that jolly robin was afraid to travel a new way of course jolly didn't want that to be said about him so he looked as cheerful as he could and he whistled the merriest tune he knew nobody except his wife maybe would have guessed that he wasn't perfectly happy
mr robin replied that he had never heard of such a thing happening he looked curiously at his son's waistcoat it does seem to look different he said it's brighter than it was
after he learned to fly jolly robin's father took him into the woods to spend each night in a roost where there were many other young robins whose fathers had likewise brought them there jolly learned a great deal from being with so many new friends it was not long before he could find plenty of food for himself without help from anyone
johnnie green liked that kind of snow because it made the best snowballs and he had had a fine time playing in the orchard near the farmhouse not long before jolly robin appeared there now the orchard was the place where jolly robin and his wife had had their nest the summer before so it was natural that he should want to go there at once and look about a bit
and then johnnie green shied a snowball at him the snowball sailed through the air and struck the stranger's battered hat knocking it off into the snow and of course jolly robin couldn't help laughing he was more surprised than ever too because the moon-faced man did not move even then
i don't understand it he said with a shake of his own head the whole affair was very odd i'm afraid i shall not care to live in the orchard this summer especially if there's a headless man there for how can he ever see to leave the orchard it was jimmy rabbit's turn to look puzzled for that was a question that he couldn't answer
and the man never paid the slightest heed to what happened said jolly robin he had a stick in his hand but he didn't throw it there's nothing queer about that jimmy rabbit remarked how could he see where to throw his stick when he had no head but jolly robin could not answer that question and he looked more puzzled than ever
you meet me in the orchard this afternoon he said when the sun's over the mountain and i'll start you on your journey so jolly robin had to wait all the long day while jasper jay did a hundred silly things such as mocking farmer green's cat and teasing a sleepy young owl and making the woods echo with his hoarse screams
perhaps jasper hadn't intended that jolly robin should hear those words and perhaps he had anyhow he was sorry afterward that he had spoken so loud for the first thing he knew jolly robin flew straight at him with shrill chirps of rage and jasper was so surprised and frightened too that he flew off as fast as he could go
over in the woods jolly was lucky enough to meet jimmy rabbit who was always very friendly toward him and as soon as he had inquired about jimmy rabbit's health they had not seen each other since the previous fall you know jolly related how he'd seen johnnie green knock off the head of the man in the orchard
there was something ghostly in the way he stood there all in white never moving never once saying a word but johnnie green did not seem frightened at all he set up a great shouting and began to let fly his snowballs as fast as he could throw them they did not all find the mark but the very last one struck the silent stranger squarely upon his left ear
well sky pond's south of pleasant valley jasper jay explained it's right on your way to your winter home and all you have to do when you reach sky pond will be to find another sign which ought to say something like this
so he travelled to his winter home in the old-fashioned way after all and though jolly robin laughed when he told his friends about jasper jay's new style of travelling there was one thing over which he could not smile even then you see fraid-cat was a name he couldn't abide
and to jolly robin's horror his head toppled off and fell horridly at his feet jolly robin fully expected the man in white to turn and chase johnnie green then or at least to hurl his stick at johnnie
following the road that led to sky pond fifteen miles away with jolly robin after him jolly chased him for a long time until at last jasper jay swerved to one side and turned toward home
what's that you say asked jasper jay and when jolly repeated his question jasper began to scream with laughter well that's a good one he said at last so you thought the post was going to pull itself out of the ground and fly away with you did you
jolly spent a very lonely night when he went to the roost where the whole robin family had been sleeping for several weeks he found it distressingly silent after the gay chatter that he had grown accustomed to hearing there and try as he would he could not keep just a hint of sadness out of his goodnight song
he was so cheerful and good-natured that rusty wren and his wife did not object to jolly's visits so long as he did not venture too near their house they always scolded loudly when an outsider came too close to their home for they had a big family of children and they couldn't help feeling that the youngsters were safer with no prying busybodies to meddle with them
of course jolly robin never once thought of harming any of rusty's family and as soon as he saw that rusty and especially his wife wanted him to keep away from their side of the tree he took care to respect their wishes
of course he hoped that a pair of wrens would build their nest inside the syrup can but what he never dreamed was that the cherry tree was exactly the sort of tree that wrens liked it was not that rusty and his wife cared for cherries
not being fond of cherries they did not look forward to the time when the bright red fruit should hang gaily upon the branches above their home but there were others besides johnnie green who eagerly awaited that time and noticed that the old tree was loaded with blossoms which meant that later there would be plenty of cherries
a number of new illustrations are added some of which are highly imaginative the tree of life tax with the twelve and the tree of knowledge are dealt with amongst other botanical objects a woman-headed serpent being introduced in the first case and adam and eve in the second
this was by no means unreasonable in their case since it was the plants of the mediterranean region that dioscorides had enumerated when however brunfels attempted to employ the same methods in his examination of the flora of the strasburg district and the left bank of the rhine many difficulties and discrepancies arose
his chapters on verbena and artemisia reflect clearly the independence of his thought he points out that the former plant is collected rather for purposes of magic than for medicine and he can hardly contain his scorn at the monkey tricks and ceremonies connected with the use of the latter
a herbal has been defined as a book containing the names and description of herbs or of plants in general with their properties and virtues the word is believed to have been derived from a medieval latin adjective herbalis the substantive liber being understood
one of the sections of which it is composed is concerned with an account of a large number of trees and herbs arranged in alphabetical order and is chiefly occupied with their medicinal properties it also includes some theoretical considerations about plants on aristotelian lines
the noblest of all created things thereupon i thought on the wondrous order which the creator gave these same creatures of his so that everything which has its being under heaven receives it from the stars and keeps it by their help
it has lately become accessible in the form of a facsimile reprint the words paradisi in sole form a pun upon the author's name and may be translated of park in sun the book was dedicated to queen henrietta maria with the prayer that she will accept this speaking garden
the first edition opens with a full page woodcut modified from that at the beginning of the german herbarius and representing a group of figures who appear to be engaged in discussing some medical or botanical problem before the treatise on animals there is another large engraving of three figures with a number of beasts at their feet
he is known to have made a stay at tubingen and it is highly probable that he became personally acquainted with leonhard fuchs cordus had always longed to see under their native skies the plants about which the ancients had written and in fulfillment of this dream he undertook a long excursion into italy
there is in the british museum a beautiful copy of the fifty and thirty sixth edition with a binding stamped in gold and bearing the arms of mary duchess of suffolk daughter of henry the seventh
whose initials appear on the portrait of bock reproduced in text figure twenty-six the wood cuts of trees in the third part of the book are particularly noticeable see text figures twenty-eight and ninety-two and are often made more interesting by the introduction of figures of men and animals
this statement fuchs supports by means of actual examples it must nevertheless be admitted that even if their quality was poor the herbals published by egenolph and his successors did good service in disseminating some knowledge of the plant world among a very wide public
in spite of the fact that he used no charm incantation or magic character but went upon his search without superstition box freedom from the credulity which permeated the work of so many of the early botanists is one of his most remarkable characteristics
for as he was able to give names to all the living creatures according to their several natures so no doubt but he had also the knowledge both what herbs and fruits were fit either for meat or medicine for use or for delight
the royal fern osmunda was traditionally supposed to bear seed upon st john's eve though ferns were generally believed at that time to have no organs of fructification to test this statement bock four times spent the night in the forest he found small black seed like poppy seed
than the date of their publication would seem to suggest this characteristic is illustrated in the encyclopdia of bartholomus anglicus and in konrad von megenberg's das puch der natur which were perhaps the earliest printed books containing strictly botanical information
of a truth i would as soon count thee the leaves on the trees or the grains of sand in the sea as the things which are the causes of a relapse from the temperament of the four natures and a beginning of man's sickness
the goose tree is also figured by de l'obel and d'alchamps but it is refreshing to find that colonna in his future basins  fifteen ninety two flatly denies the truth of the legend
his father euricius cordus was a physician botanist and man of letters so valerius was brought up in a fortunate environment at sixteen he graduated at the university of marburg
the duchess may perhaps have inherited a taste for herbals from her father for the british museum also possesses a copy of vrard's translation of the ortus sanitatis which is known to have been purchased by him
the treatise on fishes begins with a landscape with water enlivened by shipping there are two figures in the foreground and in the water fishes crabs and mythical monsters such as mermen are seen disporting themselves
in so far as the author pleads for the treatment of botany as a separate subject and not as a mere branch of medicine his remarks on this point may be translated as follows
terrestris a garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our english ayre will permitt to be noursed up together with the right orderinge planting and preserving of them and their uses and vertues
and certainly if we accept his account of the state of knowledge at the time the need for such a book must have been most urgent he explains that while he was still at pembroke hall cambridge he endeavoured to learn the names of plants but such was the ignorance in simples at that time
bock seems to have been a keen collector although hampered by ill health and a great point in his favour is that he described only those plants which had come under his own personal observation
among all the herbals which exist today there are none which have more of the crassest errors than those which egenolph the printer has already published again and again
that he could get no information on the subject even from physicians he claims that his herbal has considerable originality a claim which seems well founded in his own words
and now first translated out of french into english by henry lyte esquire the illustrations used in the book were the same as those which had appeared in the translation by de l'ecluse
which meant to publish the same but being prevented by death his translation likewise perished after the manner of the period the herbal is embellished with a number of prefatory letters in one of which written by stephen bredwell the statement occurs which is so inconsistent with gerard's own remarks
that he certainly committed an oversight in allowing it to stand in bredwell's words d priest for his translation of so much of dodonus hath hereby left a tomb for his honorable sepulture master gerard coming last but not the least hath in many ways accommodated the whole work unto our english nation
and before that on birds there is a lively picture with an architectural background showing a scene which swarms with innumerable birds of all kinds whose peculiarities are apparently being discussed by two savants in the foreground
he seems to have been of a restless temperament which was probably accentuated by the persecution to which his protestant opinions exposed him his career for more than forty years consisted of periods of active practice alternating with periods of university teaching
elaborate directions for the planting and treatment of a garden precede an account of a large number of plants cultivated at that time with some mention of their uses the book is illustrated with full-page wood engravings of no great merit in each of which a number of different plants are represented
cesalpino's strength lay in the fact that he took a remarkably broad view of the subject and approached it as a trained thinker he had learned the best lesson greek thought had to offer to the scientific worker
the editions produced under the auspices of adam lonicer the publisher's son-in-law are particularly well known no other botanical work of the period had a success comparable to that of his long series of books of which rhodion's kreutterbuch was the prototype
and to these he added a fifth the ether in the four elements the four principles are combined in pairs fire being characterised by heat and dryness air by heat and moisture water by cold and moisture and earth by cold and dryness according to aristotle heat and cold are active while dryness and moisture are passive in their nature
the herball is a massive volume in clear roman type contrasting markedly with the black letter used in the works of turner and lyte and giving the book a much more modern appearance
by the temperament of a man is understood the balance or proportion maintained between these conflicting tendencies the particular virtues of each plant in other words the power of restoring lost health or temperament are determined by the principles which it contains and the proportions in which these occur
i have in my time at diverse times taken up the roots of mandrake out of the ground but i never saw any such thing upon or in them as are in and upon the peddlers roots that are comely to be sold in boxes
the chief tangible contribution which cesalpino made to botanical science was his insistence on the prime importance of the organs of fructification this was the idea on which he chiefly laid stress in his system of classification to which we shall return in a later chapter
after this episode the relations between the two botanists seem not unnaturally to have become somewhat strained gerard evidently aimed at conveying information in simple language for in one place where he speaks of a preparation being squirted into the eyes
also how he afterwards formed the four elements fire hot and dry air hot and moist water cold and moist earth dry and cold and gave to each a nature of its own and how after this the same great master of nature made and formed herbs of many sorts and animals of all kinds and last of all man
god the creator of heaven and earth at the beginning when he created adam inspired him with the knowledge of all natural things which successively descended to noah afterwards and to his posterity
it is customary to connect medicine with botany yet scientific treatment demands that we should consider each separately for the fact is that in every art theory must be disconnected and separated from practice and the two must be dealt with singly and individually in their proper order before they are united
the most attractive is perhaps that of the dodder climbing on a plant with flowers and pots text figure seventy-seven which is drawn in a masterly fashion these woodcuts form the basis of nearly all botanical illustrations for the next half-century being copied and recopied from book to book
which happens when heat takes to the upper hand and strives to stifle cold or on the contrary when cold begins to suppress heat or man becomes full of cold moisture or again is deprived of the due measure of moisture
it is also to be noted that the four natures in question are also mixed and blended in the human body in a measure and temperament suitable to the life and nature of man while man keeps within this measure proportion or temperament he is strong and healthy but as soon as he steps or falls beyond the temperament or measure of the four natures
i considered further how that in everything which arises grows lives or soars in the four elements named be it metal stone herb or animal the four natures of the elements heat cold moistness and dryness are mingled
and because i would not be like unto a crier it cryeth lost horse in the marketh and telleth all the marks and tokens that he hath and yet never saw the horse neither could know the horse if we saw him i went into italy and into diverse parts of germany to know and see the herbs myself
he was born in fifteen o one at membdingen in bavaria and at an early age he became a student of the university of ferfurt where he is said to have taken a bachelor's degree in his thirteenth year
after this he turned his attention to medicine and took a doctor's degree at ingolstadt he came under the influence of luther's writing which won him over to the reformed faith fuchs began to practise as a physician at munich but in fifteen twenty-six he returned to ingolstadt as professor of medicine
had clearly pointed out that the provinces of asia have each their own characteristic plants and that some which occur in one region are absent from another hieronymus bock who in his latin writings called himself targos text figure twenty-six was a contemporary of brunfels
and were for the most part copies of those in the octavo edition of fuchs's herbal with some additional blocks which had been cut specially for dodoens the result is that many of the same figures occur both in turner and in lyte there are said to be eight hundred seventy figures in lyte's herbal of which about thirty are new
the roots which are counterfeited and made like little puppets and mammets which come to be sold in england in boxes with heir and such forme as man hath are nothing else but foolish feined trifles and not natural for they are so trimmed of crafty thieves to mock the poor people with all and to rob them of both their wit and their money
as a herbal it does not rank high since zaluziansky neither recorded any new plants nor gave the bohemian localities for those already known but it opens with a survey of botany in general which is of interest as showing an approach to the modern scientific standpoint
this he did according to his own account in very many places but yet not so many as he wished since gerard became impatient and summarily stopped the process of emendation on the ground that de l'obel had forgotten his english
bock's chief claim to remembrance however does not lie in his figures but in his descriptions which were a great advance on those previously published he was careful also to note the mode of occurrence and localities of the plants mentioned and in this feature his work showed some approach to a flora in the modern sense of the word
from the botanical point of view they represent a considerable advance since the details of floral structure are often shown on an enlarged scale camerarius was a good observer and his travels furnished him with much information regarding the localities for the plants which he described
the german herbarium was much copied and translated into other languages the original set of figures being as a rule reproduced on a smaller scale according to dr payne the earliest french edition called arbolayre derived from the latin herbolarium is now an exceedingly rare book
he apologises for the colloquialism explaining that he does not wish to be over eloquent among gentlewomen unto whom especially my works are most necessary the value of gerard's work must inevitably be at a discount
this folio which was the foundation of the later works called hortus or ortus sanitatis appeared at mainz also from the printing press of peter schoeffer in fourteen eighty five the year following the publication of the latin
this success was however achieved in the teeth of much adverse contemporary criticism folks in the preface of his historias de pion fifteen forty two referred with unsparing touch to egenolph's botanical mistakes his trenchant indictment may be rendered into english as follows
may easily perceive that i taught the truth of certain plants which these above named writers either knew not at all or else erred in them greatly so it as i learned something of them so they ether might or did learn something of me again as their second editions may testify
the descriptions and figures of the herbs are arranged alphabetically all the plants discussed were natives of germany or in cultivation there and the object of the work seems to have been to help the reader to the use of cheap and easily obtained remedies in case of illnesses or accident
nearly one third of the figures of herbs are new the rest are copied on a reduced scale from the german herbarius and the drawing which is by no means improved often shows that the copyist did not fully understand the nature of the object he was attempting to portray
the knowledge of how to think he had however the defects of his qualities and his reverence for the classics led him into an inelastic and over literal acceptance of aristotelian conceptions
before the treatise on stones there is a very spirited scene representing a number of figures in a jeweller's shop and two large wood-cuts of doctors and their patients illustrate the medical portion with which the book concludes
he adds insult to injury by gratuitously remarking in an address to the reader at the beginning of the herbal that doctor priest one of our london college hath as i heard translated the last edition of dodonus
till that i have seen the west country which i never saw yet in all my life which country of all places of england as i hear say is most richly replenished with all kinds of strange and wonderful works and gifts of nature as are stones herbs fishes and metals
he explains that while waiting to complete his herbal he has been advised to publish this little book in which he has set forth the names of plants he adds and because men should not think that i write of that i never saw and that apothecaries should be excuseless when as the right herbs are required of them
he treats of variation within single species the sensitiveness of plants their chemistry and properties and many other topics his work is full of interest but a discussion of it would lead us beyond the bounds of our present subject
the preface to this work is entirely at variance with the idea that scientific knowledge has only been gradually acquired by the human race in parkinson's words
a man whose actual achievement was small but who if he had not died so young would probably have become one of the most famous of the earlier herbalists
they that have read the first part of my herbal and have compared my writings of plants with those things that matthiolus fuchsius tragus and dodoneus wrote in the first editions of their herbals
it is thus exactly comparable in origin with the word manual in the sense of a hand-book four early printed editions of the herbal of apuleius platonicus are known all of which appear to have been based on different manuscripts
this scheme grew into one of a more extensive and general nature but without losing the predominant medical interest which would have characterised the work as originally planned in accordance with this intention the virtues of the herbs are dealt with in great detail
the earliest was published in rome late in the fifteenth century from a manuscript discovered by johannes philippus de lignamine physician to pope sixtus the fourth nothing is definitely known concerning the author but it is conjectured that he was a native of africa and that his book may date from the fifth century or possibly even the fourth
it contains about eighteen hundred wood cuts nearly all from blocks used by tabernmontanus in his eicones of fifteen ninety which norton obtained from frankfort less than one per cent are original
he complains that the publication of the work has been delayed partly through the disastrous times but chiefly through the machinations of wretched and perverse men
as an example of a wood-cut which has lost much of its character in copying we may take the daughter compare texas eighty and seventy seven the ortus sanitatis is very rich in pictures
and for that reason in order that botany which is as it were a special branch of physics may form a unit by itself before it can be brought into connection with other sciences it must be divided and unyoked from medicine guy de la brosse
gerard did not know enough about botany to couple the wood blocks of tabernmontanus with their appropriate descriptions and de l'obel was requested by the printer to correct the author's blunders
the treatise on plants is considerably modified from the german herbarius and the virtues of the herbs described are dealt with at greater length the herbarium of apuleius platonicus is more than once quoted though not by name
he had no understanding of the geographical distribution of plants and did not realise that different regions have dissimilar floras it is curious that this should have been so when we remember that theophrastus more than eighteen hundred years earlier
with this introduction we may pass on to the preface of the herbarius zu teutsch many a time and oft have i contemplated inwardly the wondrous works of the creator of the universe how in the beginning he formed the heavens and adorned them with goodly shining stars to which he gave power and might to influence everything under heaven
turner had a fine scorn for any superstitious notions he detected in the writings of his contemporaries and seems to have been particularly pleased if he could show that in any disputed matter they were wrong while the ancients for whom he had great reverence were right
this herbal contains many evidences of turner's independence of thought he fought against what he regarded as superstition in science with the same ardour with which he entered upon religious polemics the legend of the human form of the mandrake receives scant mercy at his hands as he points out
after a period of school teaching he resumed his studies this time at the university of ingolstadt where he devoted himself chiefly to classics and became a master of arts
the importance of gerard's herball in the history of botany is chiefly due to an improved edition brought out by thomas johnson in sixteen thirty-three thirty six years after the work was originally published johnson was an apothecary in london and cultivated a physic garden on snow hill

bande mataram i gently lifted bimala back to into her chair and lest reaction should set in i began again without losing time queen the divine mother has laid on me the duty of establishing her worship in the land but alas i am poor bimala was still flushed her eyes clouded her accents thick as she replied you poor
the wealthy shall hasten to throw upon their treasure for your acceptance those who have nothing else shall beg to be allowed to offer their lives o my king my god what you have seen in me i know not but i have seen the immensity of your grandeur in my heart
i am humble follower of these great ones when i was attached to the congress party i never hesitate to dilute ten percent of the truth with ninety percent of untruth
god is necessary to clear away our illusions the divinities which keep them alive are false gods what of that if need be even false gods must be invoked rather than let the work suffer
at first there was no intelligible answer then it became clear that the bond against which i had been fretting inwardly night and day had broken to my surprise i discovered that my mind was freed from all mistiness i could see everything relating to bimala as if vividly pictured on a camera screen
while panchu was thus engaged the full shock of the swadeshi flood fell on him seven it was vacation time and many youths of our village and its neighbourhood
my nerves rang music like tuned up strings but the symphony stopped short at the first movement what stood in the way nothing singly it was a tangle of a multitude of things nothing definitely palpable but only that unaccountable sense of obstruction
but keep their eyes as always fixed or on thereafter i have long been nursing a plan which if only i could carry it out would set fire to the whole country true patriotism will never be roused in our countrymen unless they can visualize the motherland
had come home from their schools and colleges they attached themselves to sandip's leadership with enthusiasm and some in their excess of zeal gave up their studies altogether many of the boys had been free pupils of my school here and some held college scholarships from me in calcutta
sandip laughed right sir said he quite a correct speech for a schoolmaster this is the kind of stuff i have read in books but in the real world i have seen that man's chief business is the accumulation of outside material
but the glow on their genius enthusiasm lighted them up within as well as without it became quite clear that when the pure breezes of great joy and hope sweets sweep through the land all dirt and decay are cleansed away
it was palpable that she had specially dressed herself to coax that order out out of me till that moment i had never viewed bimala's adornment as a thing apart from herself but today the elaborate manner in which she had done up her hair in the english fashion made it appear a mere decoration
this sort of thing makes my husband beam all over and the house is deluged with indian scents and soaps soaps indeed they are more like lumps of caustic soda and do i not know that what my sister-in-law uses on herself are the european soaps of old
we must make a goddess of her my colleagues saw the point at once let us divide an appropriate image they exclaimed it will not do if you devise it i admonished them
the house which becomes empty through the parting of lovers still has music left in the heart of its emptiness but the house that is empty because hearts are asunder is awful in its silence even the cry of pain is out of place there
he seemed to have a vision of something beyond the surging present i remember one day in the course of the arguments he continually had with sandip he said good fortune comes to our gate and announces itself only to prove that we have not the power to receive it
there at the beginning of time a man and a woman first met not within walls and therefore we two must come back to nature at least once a year to tune our love anew to the first pure note of the meeting of hearts
i could see at once that she had been unsuccessful with nikhil she had been so proudly confident that she would have her own way but i had never shared her confidence woman knows man well enough where he's weak but she's quite unable to fathom him where he's strong
you have spent your whole past in a superior compartment and now you come down to use them as tools for the wreaking of your wrath i call it cowardly
they have found their true wealth so for men to accept is truly to give for women to give is truly to gain the demand i have just made from bimala however is indeed a large one at first i felt scruples
when bimala stood silently there flushed and tearful in her broken pride like a storm-cloud laden with rain and charged with lightning lowering over the horizon she looked so absolutely sweet that i had to right go right up to her and take her by the hand it was trembling but she did not snatch it
and succeeded in acquiring philosophy enough to forget that his children went hungry he kept himself steeped for a time in the idea that the world is vanity and if of pleasure it has none pain also in delusion then at last one night he left his little ones in their tumble-down hovel
it was difficult for me to ignore the fact that the same month of august had come round again this year does bimala remember it i wonder she has given me no reminder everything is mute about me it is august the sky breaks into a passionate rain alas empty is my house
for what fault i enquired because i was told he has been found selling foreign cloths he begged and prayed harish kundu his zamindar to let him sell off his stock
this cry of pain must be silenced in me so long as i continue to suffer bimala will never have true freedom i must free her completely otherwise i shall never gain my freedom from untruth
and started off wandering on his own account i knew nothing of this at the time for just then a veritable ocean churning by gods and demons was going on in my head nor did my master tell me that he had taken panchu's deserted children under his roof and was caring for them through all alone in the house with his school to attend to the whole day
man's worship has idolized his passion but there must be no more human sacrifices at at its shrine i went into my bedroom this morning to fetch a book it is long since i have been there in the daytime a pang passed through me as i looked round it today
i have had words with nikhil about it said sandip he tells me he does not mind specifying but he will not have coercion i will see to that i said with a proud sense of power
bimala slid down from her seat and fell at my feet which she clasped and then she sobbed and sobbed and sobbed this is hypnotism the charm which can subdue the world no materials no weapons but just the delusion of irresistible suggestion who says truth shall triumph
illusions are necessary for lesser minds i said and to this class the greater portion of the world belongs that is why divinities are set up in every country to keep up the illusions of the people for men are only too well aware of their weakness no he replied
it is no use arguing about these things nikhil my master interposed how can they who do not feel the truth within them realize that to bring it out from its obscurity into the light is man's highest aim not to keep on heaping material outside
you may do as you please to work off your irritation to keep up your fanaticism you are well off you need not mind the cost the poor do not want to stand in your way but you insist on their submitting to your compulsion
what then is your plan there is one only well-known way of avoiding quarrels said nikhil meaningly i know that like tales written by good people nikhil's discourse always ends in a moral
bought with borrowed money promising faithfully never to do it again but the zamindar would not hear of it and insisted on his burning the foreign stuff there and then if he wanted to be let off panchu in his desperation blurted out defiantly i can't afford it you are rich why not buy it up and burn it
i used to tell bimala that a song must come back to its refrain over and over again the original refrain of every song is in nature where the rain laden wind passes over the rippling stream where the green earth drawing its shadows veil over its face keep its ear close to the speaking water
for is it not the habit of man's mind to be in purposeless conflict with itself i thought i had imposed too hard a task my first impulse was to call her back and tell her i would rather not make her life wretched by dragging her into all these troubles
but a woman is not built that way she's soft and supple so that she may bend without being crooked i could not forget those words you are his dissipation and will be his ruin today i feel if a man needs must have some intoxicant let it not be a woman
with which he threw himself at my feet i asked him to come ten days later if only we could pay him that two thousand rupees at once we could buy him up body and soul
and now merely because i have ceased to belong to that party i have not forgotten the basic fact that man's goal is not truth but success true success corrected my master
political cookery on a large scale is doubtless going on but oh i know you of course will never do any of the cooking you prefer to be one of those down whose throats the hotchpotch which is being cooked will be crammed
the only one ever handled the fact is all this was intended as a hit at me because i would i would not keep my husband company in his vagaries it was no good trying to show up my sister-in-law's insincerity my husband's face would set so hard if i barely touched on it
what a wealth of color and movement suggestion and deception group themselves round this me and mine in woman that is just where her beauty lies she's ever so much more personal than man
is not all that each one has yours what are my caskets full of jewelery for drag away from me all my gold and gems for your worship i have new use for them
bee said i we two are colleagues for our aims are one let us sit down and talk it over i led her unresisting to a seat but strange at that very point
their very smallness protects them as the banks protect the pool by widening bounds only the slime is exposed the real fact is that bimala has only come into my home not into my life
it had no resemblance to our past and so we're led to hope that all our wants and miseries would disappear by the spell of some magic charm that for us was no longer a boundary line between the possible and the impossible everything seemed to be saying to us it is coming to us it has come
the one delight of this earth is to fulfil the claims of those who are men she has been made fertile and beautiful and complete through her endless sacrifices to them
they had become heaped up but were never before united yet in this day when had come to bengal even this collection of looseness had taken shape and proclaimed in a thundering voice at our
we must get one of the current images accepted as representing the country the worship of the people must flow towards it along the deep-cut grooves of custom but nikhil's need must argue even about this we must not seek the help of illusions he said to me some time ago but what we believe to be true cause
and the more we claimed the more she submitted from primeval days we have been plucking fruits cutting down trees digging up the soil killing beast bird and fish
it is because i strongly believe in god said my husband that i feel so certain that our preparations for this worship are lacking god has power to give the boon but we must have the power to accept it
in the morning light on the clothes rack was hanging a sari of bimala's crinkled ready for wear on the dressing-table were her perfumes her comb her hair-pins and with them still her vermilion box underneath were her tiny gold-embroidered slippers
whose absorbing powers must be reckoned with the manager will take what he wants i also have my own wants these lesser wants form a part of wants of the great cause the horse must be fed and the wheels must be oiled if the best progress is to be made
likewise by sheer force of our claims we men have opened up all the latent possibilities of women in the process of surrendering themselves to us they have ever gained their true greatness because they had to bring all the diamonds of their happiness and the pearls of their sorrow into our royal treasury
the rush of my impetuosity suffered an unaccountable check just as the current of the mighty padma roaring on its irresistible course all of a sudden gets turned away from the bank it is crumbling by some trifling obstacle beneath the surface when i pressed bimala's hand
maybe replied sandip but the fruit of the true success ripens only by cultivating the field of untruth after tearing up the soil and pounding it into the dust truth grows up by itself like weeds and thorns and only worms can expect to get fruit from it
with this he flung out of the room my master smiled as he looks towards me do you know nikhil he said i believe sandip is not irreligious his religious is of observe size of truth
i took no notice of the insult in their tone and was about to reply that the loss would fall on the poor traders and their customers not on me when my master who was present interposed yes the loss will be his not yours that is clear enough he said
if the idea of a united india is a true one objects nikhil mussulmans are a necessary part of it quite so said i but we must know their place and keep them there otherwise they will constantly be giving trouble so you want to make trouble to prevent trouble
when man was being made the creator was a schoolmaster his bag full of commandments and principles but when he came to woman he resigned his headmastership and turned artist with only his brush and paint box
you are his only dissipation and you will be his ruin whatever you may say it is not right to be double-faced i retorted my sister-in-law laughed out in my face oh you artless little chota rani straight as a schoolmaster's rod eh
am i taking them they are for the divine mother to be poured in worship at her feet oh but it must be a grand ceremony of worship such as the country has never beheld before it must be a landmark in our history it shall be my supreme
but now you would dictate what salt they shall eat what clothes they shall wear why should they put up with such tyranny and why should we let them but we have taken to indian salt and sugar and cloth ourselves
as it is every moment of theirs is a life and death struggle for a bare living you cannot even imagine the difference a few pence means to them so little have you in common
but when sandip came and settled here and his followers began to move about the country speaking in towns and marketplaces waves of excitement came rolling up to us as well a band of young fellows of the locality attached themselves to him some even had been known as a disgrace to the village
though her own people are not well off she was born a rani she has no doubts in her mind that there is a lower unit of measure for the trials and troubles of the lower classes want is of course a permanent feature of their lives but does not necessarily mean want to them
that we have not kept things ready to be able to invite into it into our homes no was sandip's answer you talk like an atheist because you do not believe in our gods to us it has been made quite visible that the goddess has come with a boom yet you distrust the obvious signs of her presence
have we been able as i began to believe with all our heart in the god for whose worship we have been born all these millions of year until he actually made himself visible to us how i often have i told you i continued that had i not seen you i never would have known all my country as one
those who are masters in the art advertise the biggest lies in their business enter false accounts into their political ledgers with their broadest pointed pens launch their newspapers daily laden with untruths and send preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood like flies carrying palestinian germs
but for one's country the country does not mean the soil but the men on it interrupted my master again have you yet wasted so much as a glance on what was happening to them
who am i what am i in its presence ah the awful power of devastation never shall i truly live till it kills me utterly i can bear it no longer my heart is breaking
the strange part of it is that with all his familiarity with moral prospects he still believes in them he is an incorrigible schoolboy his only merit is his sincerity the mischief with people like him is that they will not admit the finality even of death
the first two anniversaries of our marriage life i spent in calcutta where i went through my examinations but from the next year onward for seven years without a break we have celebrated our union among the blossoming water-lilies now begins the next octave of my life
unfortunately for us our illusions are alive enough but we do not know how to make them serve our purpose look at the brahmins in spite of our treating them as demi-gods and untiringly taking the dust of their feet they are a force going to waste
once before bimala had offered up her own ornaments i am not usually in the habit of drawing lines but i felt i had to draw the line there i know why i feel this hesitation it is for the man to give ornaments to woman to take them from her wounds his manliness but i must forget myself
thus we came to cherish the belief that our history needed no steed but that like heaven's chariot it would move into its own inherent power at least no wages would have to be paid to the charioteer
delusion shall win in the end the bengali understood this when he conceived the image of the ten handed goddess astride her lion and spread her worship in the land bengal must now create a new image to enchant and conquer the world
very own door here i am how could we help thinking that it was all supernatural this moment of our history seemed to have dropped into our hand like a jewel from the crown of some drunken god
he made no direct reply the boat was worth two thousand rupees he said i now see my mistake and if excused this will never i i will never
this kind of talk from my husband would only annoy me i could not keep from joining in you think this excitement is only a fire of drunkenness but not drunkenness up to a point give strength
they came up in a body and demanded that i should banish foreign goods from my suksar market i told them i could not do it they were sarcastic why maharaja will the loss be too much for you
yes my husband replied it may give strength but not weapons but strength is a gift of the god i went on weapons can be supplied by mere mechanics my husband smiled
the long and short of it is that money we must have and that soon we must take whatever comes the readiest for we cannot afford to wait i know that the immediate often swallows up the ultimate that the five thousand rupees of today may nip up in the bud of fifty thousand rupees of tomorrow but i must accept the penalty
only his wine cup would have to be filled again and again and then in some impossible paradise the goal of our hopes would be reached my husband was not altogether unmoved but through all our excitement it was the strain of sadness in which deepened and deepened
