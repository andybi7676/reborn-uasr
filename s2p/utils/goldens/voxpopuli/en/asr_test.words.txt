mr president the purpose of the three oral amendments which i am going to present now is to keep the report up to date and to reflect what has been negotiated this morning in the area of cooperation and information sharing as regards the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements
what really saddens me is that the commission together with the chosen ones used manipulation and misleading facts that would make this report the way they proposed look good but unfortunately on paper only

they need to end the recruitment of children
a european democracy needs more open and inclusive institutions we need bold decisions in order to overcome mistrust and apathy
therefore there is a lot of work ahead of us
it should be expanded and all member states should contribute
so what can be done
i cite the obama administration the joint comprehensive plan of action is not a treaty or an executive agreement and it is not a signed document'
they attack all of us

i think we have found a good compromise in the framework of this report in which we said that tackling climate change is an important objective

at the present moment there is no more important global issue than the preservation of peace
unfortunately this proposal was not adopted by the lead committee and i must say i regret that

twenty five the problem is that most of the eu funding allocated to addressing youth unemployment will be allocated to countries with a much higher youth unemployment rate than sweden so we are the backyard and we can pay for the other countries which is totally unfair as have i said already solidarity is very easy when other people's money is involved youth unemployment is today again an item on the agenda of this house again we have recommendations on how to tackle youth unemployment in the
this parliament and this european union have the same objectives as the out of control leaders of the world wars to create a state as powerful as possible on the european continent
this house is entitled to all of its varied and many opinions but i personally believe as a lawyer that alleged wrongdoings should be examined with a clear mind and always with fairness and respect
so what are we going to create now
yet very little is achieved through lecturing one another far more progress can be made through a dialogue which is constructive and cooperative
we will support you in your initiatives in all the priorities that we all share here
we need to raise the ambition level before two thousand and twenty and at the same time we have to create a credible pathway towards a low carbon planet we who are economically stronger must help those who are most vulnerable to climate change

more than one hundred million christians suffer from religious persecution
that vision made it possible for europe to go through an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity

we also need to increase security measures to prevent europeans travelling to join isis
while i respect one country two systems' i find it shocking that a country run by a communist party appears to be advocating a system which gives representation only to those with wealth and privilege

we are also very specifically identifying and delivering an increase of bed capacity as well as calibrating training for the volunteers who would like to go
the transformation of institutions provided for by the dcfta will also create a more stable environment for moldovan businesses for moldovan citizens
we need to help them re connect with their children through better communication
it finally i very much support everybody who spoke about root causes of this problem
i believe his remarks were explicitly racist and xenophobic and promoted racial intolerance in a way that is not acceptable or allowed in the constitution of this house
i am afraid that the european union will also become an administrative lame duck because there are these dark clouds hanging over the administration
groups like isis can still fill this void by spreading their false narrative using social media tools that young people communicate through creating a false impression that they are joining a fight for a good cause against oppressive regimes
i would like to answer you in english
both those wars started because governments failed to take steps when they were needed most and in that i see a parallel with the europe our ancestors fought for and the battle we are trying not to lose right now
we think it is a good idea to install a specific committee in this parliament to have a debate on these issues
we smell trouble before the rest of the world gets to see
we have the state that protects those who have know and can and which should protect those who cannot protect themselves which it does not do this parliament is like a golden castle difficult to enter and from which it is even more difficult to see how people live outside

the cabinets of the vice president and the relevant commissioners need to have capable and experienced roma experts to supply the necessary hands on experience that the previous commission did not have at the level which is needed together with the major european roma organisations the commission must put in place an efficient monitoring mechanism that can show the progress that is going to be made by two thousand and twenty and that includes what we know has not been done by two thousand and fourteen
all i was saying is that the us administration at the moment is a lame duck as the result of the elections putting the administration opposite congress

medical evacuation capacity will be based on more than just the commission's three a week and that is what we would be delivering for the safety of health workers
we have more than doubled funding to fight ebola
i fully support this proposal and hope that it will help all europeans working abroad
she said that a privileged group is taking control of the election
pension rights are an especially important topic in these times of precarious employment economic difficulties and demographic changes many europeans including myself in the past travel across the continent in search of gainful employment
because they have better health systems and of course in nigeria we also had fifty international us experts coming to help
but to do so they expect medical evacuation we now have in the commission a contract for medical evacuation and member states such as the uk germany and italy are also going to join
firstly data protection procedures should be in line with the opinions of the european data protection supervisor
seriously we are obliged to do everything to protect socially and in any other respect those who cannot protect themselves the weak the poor the uneducated and those too young or too old to be able to cope with the world as it is this is the only way to
it will create incentives for fdi flows into the moldovan economy which should be transformed modernised evolved towards a high value added type of economy

our mediation is not enough
beware our enemy is now within our very own ranks and is listening as we speak
for months and months we were trying to get attention drawn to this crisis but it became visible only when it showed up on the six o'clock news so my plea as outgoing commissioner is listen to the voices of the humanitarian community in crises because we are like the canary in the mind
mr president we have witnessed a surge of young people travelling to join isis many of whom are born and raised in european countries
but it was the country itself being more capable
if pollen is an ingredient in honey then surely it must be added artificially
mr president i have another complaint about this procedure which is that it is not secret
the epidemic lasts not only do more people die but it is hugely destructive for the economies of the affected countries
christine told me that the police are beating the protestors
this debate shows that we are going hand in hand in the same direction
someone must be adding it and the finger of blame must be pointed at the bees
increasing work mobility has always been among the tenets of european integration
you do not even have the people in europe behind you
i do hope that the age of geopolitical carve outs of countries and territories has forever come to an end in europe and then nobody can possibly oppose the free will of free people democratically represented from a more purely economic point of view the agreement and the dcfta bit in it opens a whole world of opportunity for the moldovan economy
there is nothing wrong as such with competing on investment climates and business climates but this also has a state aid aspect in this area the eu has an important role
that means that individual vulnerable member states would again be liable to falling prey to isolation and costly bailouts at their taxpayers' expense the link between banking and sovereign banks would not be severed and at the same time people would end up paying for systemic failures that were also the responsibility of much bigger banks abroad
mr president on behalf of the ppe it is with great respect that i salute the new commission and i hope that all of us here in the plenary will afterwards vote for this commission
so i wish you all the best of luck
clearly if we have a surge of medical capacity this is not going to be enough and for that reason we are doing two more things
yet now that we are closer than ever to realising this goal disparaging voices arise across europe
there is only one cop conference before the paris agreement so pressure is mounting are we all on track preparing our national commitments
we are on the side of ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity
of she thanks everyone for their contribution
i express my own disappointment that the dialogue appears to be producing little outcome
the mosques must play their part in achieving this by standing up against isis and reaching out more to engage young people
it is a tall order for a one day summit but do we have an alternative while glaciers are melting
in other words the objection is not whether money is paid or not the objection is whether there is a direct link or not
however the focus should be on principles not on specific cases or countries
it is happening across europe and the silence surrounding it has many parallels with the exploitation and trafficking of young girls across many towns in northern england
who are facing increasing discrimination and persecution and find themselves in the crossfire calls on the eu and its member states to ensure that future bilateral agreements include effective monitoring mechanisms for the protection of the human rights of religious minorities'
considers that intentional forms of destructions of cultural and artistic heritage as it is currently occurring in iraq and in syria should be persecuted as war crimes and as crimes against humanity
you are a democratically elected representative
there is no such medical technique or treatment which could permit us to cross this internationally agreed principle of non modification of the human germ line
memory herself has said marriage is often the end for girls like me but if our leaders will invest in us and give us the chance to be educated we will become women who create a better society for everyone

these changes will double the share of protected trips in the eu from twenty three to forty six and will bring almost one hundred and twenty million additional trips a year within the scope of the directive furthermore the right of travellers who buy a package will be improved and clarified
this new regulation is an example of how the european union can bring concrete benefits to its citizens
the european parliament is being consistent in its support for a change in the legal base from euratom to the tfeu
this modernday form of slavery is on the rise and the eu has given the perpetrators a helping hand by not allowing member states to control their own borders and check criminal backgrounds the eu is enabling this crime to escalate
there will be clearer rights for travellers when something goes wrong during the trip and improved termination rights travellers will be entitled to extended accommodation for at least three days if the return journey cannot be carried out on time because for example a natural disaster

racism against roma is racism too and cannot and should not be tolerated any longer
when will the high representative loudly and clearly condemn the palestinian stabbings of israeli civilians

we need to be coherent and fair with our international and transatlantic partners
we have to ensure that spending schemes outline the results to be achieved
the debate today and the release of the five presidents' report on monday have clearly shown that the report is already outdated with regard to events going on outside this house
it was too difficult for this parliament to commemorate this event
it is the people you were talking to when you were canvassing
personally i believe that today we need more awareness by the member states that we need a true common european policy
in india it is illegal for girls under eighteen to be married yet unicef estimates that around forty seven of girls in india were married before they turned eighteen simply changing the law is not enough information awareness and education campaigns are crucially important to stamp out this terrible practice
so this is our goal
bearing in mind the divergent expectations and concerns of the different stakeholder groups and the different aspects we had to take into account i am convinced that we have achieved a more than respectable result
the money spent should always achieve the intended result
instead you represent the two three million people who have signed the european citizens' initiative to stop ttip it is the one hundred and fifty zero people who have contributed to the public consultation on isds and who were ninety seven negative on the whole idea
assassination are punished
religious extremism and terror are not only costing thousands of lives in syria iraq and elsewhere but also increasingly pose a threat to our own national security
we also call for consultation with independent experts when the maximum levels need to be reviewed
it is obvious that boris was killed by forces that spread darkness aggression and hatred in russia
' however passing laws is not the end of the story for even when child marriage is illegal it is still common
at the same time the new directive will provide a minimum level of protection for linked travel arrangements which are looser combinations of travel services
to defend our values and principles means to defend our identity and its future
mr president earlier this year malawi to its very great credit banned forced child marriage
commercial practices the commission will also address the issue of commercial practices whereby travel services providers who market their services online offer additional services in an unclear or ambiguous manner such as hiding the option of not booking any further services and the commission
the annexes laying down maximum levels as well as the radioactive substances concerned will be reviewed as and when new scientific data become available
enough pretending that we do not understand what is really happening in ukraine
a trustful relationship is based upon mutual confidence and trust
let us be clear the only liberal democracy in the middle east will never be a bigger problem than the evil dictatorships and terrorist groups in the surrounding region
it has done so on previous occasions on previous files concerning the threats to public health from radioactive material
bless every drop of blood that has been spilled for jerusalem
restrictions linked to geo blocking prevent european citizens from enjoying cultural diversity across borders and european companies from fully benefiting from the possibilities offered by the digital environment
i wish to reiterate that frontex is one of our best agencies and the people who work for frontex are of the highest integrity
more needs to be done
however i am afraid that it has more to do with the upcoming october elections than with any substantial changes in the government's approach to human rights and political freedom
travel businesses will also benefit from the new directive
we had time slots distributed
ladies and gentlemen the text that is now presented to you for adoption is the result of very intensive and i must say sometimes difficult negotiations and compromises between the council and parliament
one of the leading campaigners for this tremendous change was an eighteen year old woman called memory banda who started her advocacy on the issue when her own sister was married at the age of eleven to a man in his early thirties
it is ethically and legally unacceptable to permit the creation of embryos with dna from three parents
but to do this we also need to be firm with the ukrainians and tell them that they need to implement their reforms
we have to find proper answers to the question of what to do when our concept of soft power known as the concept of sharing is threatened by the concept of imposing by means of hard power
so how can we act
uk law imposes a maximum sentence of seven years on the perpetrators of this crime and it is simply not a strong enough deterrent
can we do better in the future
enough pretending that we do not understand who and with whose arms is killing thousands of ukrainians even today
this was a tremendous victory in a country which has one of the highest rates of forced child marriage in the world
by doing this you are not contributing to a constructive eu role in the current situation
we also do not need to leave the back door open for a retreat and to go back to business as usual with russia just because we can find excuses to do this
it is essential that we cooperate effectively and intelligently with all our partners sharing information about firearms trafficking and terrorist financing and learning from our previous mistakes
we now have a good report asking the commission to review the maximum levels and to allow for the adoption of implementing acts for swift action in emergency situations
so let us not live in an illusion and let us be realistic because ukraine is our strategic interest
it is not business europe or the american chamber of commerce whose agenda is the basis for this agreement
let us prove together not competing with each other but together that this is not the case
it is not the lawyers who are benefiting from an exploding number of isds cases
following tomorrow's vote by the european parliament the commission's next task will be to ensure the timely and correct transposition of the new directive by the member states
ttip will also help small enterprises increase our exports create jobs and help to decrease poverty
girls are afraid to speak out others dismiss it as a cultural practice and our social services in england the police and the politicians dare not speak up for fear of being labelled racist
we need to find legislative and marketdriven solutions so that european citizens can access any work available in a member state from anywhere in the eu
i believe that it is in our interest that international law is kept which means the territorial integrity of a country and the sovereignty of a country
millions of people are being attacked in the world because of their beliefs but there is one minority that is literally hounded with a special cruelty and this is the yezidis
however the area of the uk that elected myself and my colleague here james carver from the west midlands as well we have some of the poorest people across europe in our area these people cannot afford the things that others may take for granted they cannot get work and when you take the money that could be spent on their schools
their hospitals and you redistribute it as you see fit you do a disservice to some of the poorest people in the whole of europe and it is a shame
i expect and we all expect that the member states will immediately join and make this agency capable and efficient and ready to work in the next few months
five let me cite mrs puri un women deputy executive director as a comprehensive inclusive and universal development framework for action the two thousand and thirty agenda must be our inspiration and civil society is called to harvest the gender equality compact across sustainable development human rights peace and security and the humanitarian commitments to advance its critical work'
if so we need more social policies and more policies in terms of education
i think it is important to say that we have been working in a very collegial way because we understand that either we win together or we will lose separately and this is one more example to european citizens that we can do this job
i am looking forward to a positive vote because every member of this parliament if he really cares about european union interests about the interests of our citizens and rights of our citizens and wants to make our union better will vote in this case to create this agency
i would like to see an eu china pact for africa various colleagues have mentioned this not to exploit the resources of this continent but to develop it and to serve the basic needs of the people in africa
in the time when we are facing not only challenges of migration but also challenges of cross border crime terrorism and perhaps even hybrid threats the necessary information exchange is something which can additionally help our citizens and people to feel secure and to trust that our national governments
but i think that the whole european union as i said in my speech must have the same quality of security founding members or non founding members
therefore i share the concern of my colleagues regarding the expected recommendation of the basel committee on capital flows mr ferber said this evening it is good for the us bad for europe i sincerely hope that the commission will not take into account that one size fits all'
and those who had the political responsibility for these harmful tax practices have not until now had to bear any personal consequences
firstly consumers will have to pay this bill when the low risk loans become more expensive the consumers ordinary european homeowners and the smes relying mainly on mortgage loans
it is where every country needs to step up and make this aspiration the reality of our time
indeed this agency will not be a silver bullet and it will not solve each and every issue in the european union but we must notice and we must understand that this is a highly important fundamental piece in the larger puzzle of our european union policy
i think we all can agree on a crucial fact all sdgs must deliver for gender equality and women's empowerment the stand alone goal no
is to reinforce the global partnership against wildlife trafficking by using diplomatic tools and trade policy in relation with the key source transit and consumer countries
as it is today banks put capital aside as a buffer against losses
high representatives of the government also participated in the event
therefore let me stress that it is important that the eu stay strong and focused and that we do not adopt the basel rules just for the sake of adopting rules
i highly welcome the fact that some of the most ambitious proposals for example strengthening capacities to combat illegal wildlife trade or a global support programme to reduce demand for illegal products come from eu member states i personally think that another proposal that should emerge
as well as european parliament and european commission are working for their interests on their behalf
the eu has an important role to play in addressing this issue as europe is currently a destination market for trafficking in transit to other regions as well as being for some species the source region for illegal trade the eu is a part of the problem but also a big part of the solution
still member states denied us access to some documents that cannot be accepted
we know very well there is an important link between education and employment
the country in a hypothetical situation when it is not capable of controlling its borders and when it is not willing to get assistance from the agency which is just an assistance and not a replacement for the work of a sovereign nation can also lead to the situation where member countries decide for temporary reasons and for security reasons to introduce also border controls with this country because
new capital flows will lead to a higher cost of capital for banks and mortgage banks heavily involved in low risk lending
this is for me the paramount perspective
in a secret reading room on parliament's premises we have proven that this parliament can deal with it in a very responsible way
behind this unbearable brutality there are thousands of stories with names and faces but let me tell you about one today
for example it fits very poorly in the country i come from denmark where we rely strongly on a system of low risk mortgage loans
mr president ever since the illegal annexation of the crimean peninsula by russia this parliament has been and must remain in the forefront of international protest against putin's expansionism
we are disappointed and we regret that decision but the abandonment of paris by the us administration will not mean the end of the agreement
these are values which cannot be left just to free flow
of course if it is not possible for nato to act for whatever political reason we should be able to act ourselves
imposition of switching off the life supporting treatment is nothing else than euthanasia
we need consistency across all legislative files
i would like to see how eib instruments are making the achievement of europe two thousand and twenty goals better and faster
we are also reaching out to our partners in the african union and the acp countries
in two thousand and fifteen the leaders of g seven agreed on a declaration that highlights the importance of oceans governance science
secondly i believe that the commission should propose new requirements to test the toxicity of smoke from construction products under fire and to label those products with the results so that the construction industry and consumers can make informed choices thirdly the commission should ensure a much deeper cooperation among member states to improve fire safety in buildings across the eu
therefore before reviewing the regulation on the funding of pan european parties you should ensure that the existing regulations are observed and applied with fair treatment respecting political diversity and allowing freedom of expression
i hope that the commission's mobility initiatives will not create the next problem but will be an answer for existing challenges of the road transport sector
very complicated because there was great political support for the idea
however a key aspect that we believe is lacking is synergies between the cohesion fund and the non cohesion funds such as the framework programme for research and innovation which is a programme that helps promote excellent research projects all over europe even though there have been some challenges for some parts of the union to fully participate in this programme
still nobody takes the responsibility to say that clearly and nobody seems to have the stamina or the capacity to try at least to reform it
live in the area and the eu should be neutral at least
the need for a holistic definition and application of accessibility and our group stands for accessibility in its broadest meaning accessible affordable and available
how can we protect european institutions and values from russia's hybrid warfare if each member state works on the basis of its own intelligence
this will have damaging consequences for the overall economy as it will cause a flood of financial activity to move beyond the borders of the ftt zone
this must be made a transitional position and denuclearisation must remain our medium term objective
the use of data is growing rapidly
mr president thank you for giving me the opportunity to make my first speech here in the main plenary of the european parliament
it enables european consumers who subscribe to online contact services acquired legally in their member state of residence to continue to access the service when they are temporarily in another member state

i am however worried that the winter package proposed by the commission is a missed opportunity if we want to unleash the full potential of the green transition
the seventy nine acp countries that welcome eu aid sometimes find the conditions we ask on our aid to be socially oppressive we are in no position to criticise the foreign aid practices of other countries according to the un regulations and regarding the wording i think the committee on women's rights and gender equality should always remember one thing abortion is no form of reproductive health or family

we need a revision of the minsk paradigm that should lead to the following actions in seven points stop futile appeals to russia to influence their militants under their command

before europeans used to switch off when they crossed a border
do not sign the joint declaration
they are interested in democracy but in the e environment
an agreement will be possible only if we see concrete action and real change in government legislation

it simply beggars belief that the eu is assisting another country that holds the polar opposite views and values on this issue to transport whale meat via its ports
none of the other players china the us or russia have that combination of distance and credibility and what is more there is a new momentum in eu chinese relations to create a new international architecture but it could spill over into security affairs in east asia too trump's belligerence and domestic weakness limit american engagement in the diplomatic track on north korea and this creates a vacuum
i have to say that in estonia for example we have a government where we work together social democrats and christian democrats and together we have developed a maternity package which includes eighteen months fully paid maternity or paternity

madam president after a long journey and years of hard work i am glad that we are finally having this debate about epidemics in europe and i would like to thank all my colleagues who contributed to the resolution
this decline in demand should not come as any surprise given the very high levels of toxic contaminants found in whale products including pcbs hormone disrupting chemicals and mercury
so i wish you good luck
paper a very weak proposal
the reason repeatedly given is that the eu does not have the data for individual member states and for that reason will not even attempt to give me an estimate as i said that the eu has gained from our fishing grounds is indisputable the fact that they refuse to even give an estimate of that value from all the data they do have is not acceptable
i think we have a reason to be positive tonight

the cost of hiv tb and hcv medicines for treatment and for prevention varies from one country to another
what europe needs is a closer integration in intelligence and law enforcement
this is what it is and this is a success nothing but success
it therefore threatens to give investors an extra reason not to buy europe's securities or transact with its institutions at a time when it can ill afford to drive away economic activity

being a supply side instrument we understand that it's difficult to create its own demand especially in the structure and innovation window because it was not included in incentives like that for the creation of this demand and the facts are clear very few of the projects were additional

so the budget has to be in line with the challenges of the global world in the twenty first century
we need a univocal mandate
our words have to be in line with the numbers provided in the budget

involved for their positive and constructive approach
a large part of the reason is of course illegal fishing more often than not by vessels which are registered to countries which lack the will or the resources to enforce international agreements no amount of traceability measures or extra paperwork will address the problem of reducing
the first sub question is what steps have been taken by the commission to tackle such measures and conversely have any steps been taken by third countries against any other eu measures to boost economic growth
this document should be considered therefore as a step on the road to the total ban of atomic weapons
the commission must therefore put pressure on the eu member states to end the practice which allows foreign vessels to register easily and operate under their flags
the proposal opens the issue of the victimisation of victims entitling courts not to impose penalties on criminal activities of victims which are committed under duress
at the same time the government should bring into effect its own recently declared zero tolerance policy and should establish the national committee of human rights as laid down in the constitution
seventeen member states are at less than

the commission will study the most appropriate means to achieve this objective in the union taking into account international conventions on the matter
it is of no benefit to member states to turn a blind eye to illegal fishing
the eu failed especially in demonstrating a unified and efficient approach to climate change treatment as well as in strengthening its leading political position in this agenda i consider therefore taking this resolution an act of utmost importance
and until the adoption of a framework regulation for macro financial assistance all future individual proposals for such assistance would be subject to codecision by parliament and the council
two thousand and ten finally we would also urge the commission to urge the member states to make greater use of the structural funds within the framework of the european social fund as a way of promoting equality between men and women
i would like to stress that the abolition of exequatur should constitute a real step forward in judicial integration that the commission does not see this as the mere removal of a superfluous formality but as a step forward in the mutual trust in each other's judicial systems
i also stress the importance of appropriate funding for the european institute for gender equality in lithuania and would like to highlight the need to set up the necessary funds to establish a european observatory on violence against women building on existing institutional structures

two thousand and ten the express aim of these proposals was to make the scheme sustainable as intervention stocks become increasingly scarce

both are extremely important but innovation needs to get an extra push
it goes without saying that the union may only adopt legislation where the treaties provide it with the powers to do so
governance based on legality is the most acceptable system that suits human needs
the council conclusions of last december talked about various commission proposals during

just to correct one thing i did not say that companies are doing good
this behaviour is unacceptable
over the years this programme has become one of the main sources of supply to charities working in the field of food aid more than half the products distributed by the members of the european federation of food banks in two thousand and ten originated from this programme
detention conditions are not covered by this provision it is the responsibility of member states to ensure that detention conditions and prison management respect fundamental rights and in particular that they meet agreed international standards in particular those of the council of europe
finally when it comes to innovative financial instruments we need them both for ourselves to support our economies but also to support those who are in need
if not there will be a big crisis between you and the european parliament

thirdly the attractiveness of eu assistance is also important

it distinguishes the two main dossiers human rights abuses by the current government and the iranian nuclear programme
each year more than eighteen million people receive more than four hundred and forty zero tonnes of food distributed under this programme
this will also save time and stress for all europeans who need to carry out payments in other countries
it is self evident that italy must comply with eu law just as any other member state
the total volume of the plan must also be adapted to the volume of the existing stocks when the plan is drawn up
it has a great pulling effect on each single government to change to e governance and use new ict technologies
considering the important contribution that the programme makes to meeting the poverty reduction target of the europe two thousand and twenty strategy it will in future be financed from the budget for social policies
we want the money actually to be spent on research and development not to be kept in the pocket
you can use it or you can lose it i completely agree with the previous speaker in what she said and i will not repeat it
it has actually been functioning at the expense of those taxpayers who despite the economic and financial crisis survived within fierce global competition
should the commission decide that action is required and present a proposal the council will of course examine it closely given the importance of the issue
let us not end with this one report
last april the general court set aside the provisions of the two thousand and nine plan for products purchased in the market
we react when things have already occurred
nevertheless we must be wary of iranian attempts to gain influence over the protest movement and within bahrain in general
in the meantime the commission recalls that an agreement on the basis of its two thousand and ten proposal is needed with a view to securing a food distribution plan in
i can mention two figures here
mr president the march european council confirmed the eu's role as a promoter of the highest nuclear safety standards worldwide and in the eu neighbourhood
sometimes resisting the mainland communist dictatorship and became a creator of its own destiny
why is the commission not coming up with a concrete proposal on this
the democratisation experience of eastern europe shows that democracy is not a single act but a constant process that goes well beyond simply calling elections democracy cannot be imposed democracy needs to be fully yearned for and protected by the whole society
addressing farmland acquisition by foreign investors with the risk of undermining food security such as in africa and putting in place fair trade rules to break the vicious circle whereby developing countries are locked into dire poverty despite agricultural and mineral resources
that said and given the absence of relevant treaty provisions the council has no further power to take action in the areas mentioned by the honourable members
i said that the european globalisation fund is actually taking away the burden from enterprises to elaborate specific social plans
the commission has recently adopted the two thousand and twelve plan in order to give the participating member states and charities time to find additional resources to replace the volume that will not be provided at european level

we all agree on that
turkey has never accepted this legitimate fact
having said that i am obliged to say that pernicious consequences of the existence of this fund increase the level of redistribution create market distortions and punish the successful

madam president i would like to start by thanking you all for giving me the opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the commission on the european scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons first i would like to emphasise the importance of this programme for the most deprived citizens of europe
the commission has always appreciated the clear stance of parliament on this matter
like many of my colleagues here this morning i urge the commission to provide an analysis of these distortions
the next report on the eu's accountability should include the abovementioned policy changes as well as its financial commitments
since two thousand and five the council has carried out an annual statistical survey among member states on quantitative data relating to the functioning of the european arrest warrant
the council supports these activities and would welcome other forms of support to member states in the area of detention conditions and facilities
this is key to ensuring the effective implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in the area of freedom security and justice
let us change our economic model move towards a sustainable model and create jobs
we now move to the catch the eye part of the debate

finally it is fundamental to promote the acceptance of an international role in ending the conflict in syria
nothing happened
trust me because i was one of the finalists of the presidential elections in
the heads of government have more realistic views on priorities than the unelected members of the commission and members of this parliament
risk behaviour should be approved by the board and publicly disclosed and the bonuses of officers should be linked more to long term results in order to discourage risky behaviour that endangers the company in the long run
in the meantime migrants and asylum seekers still risk their lives at sea to reach it can the unsafe harbour status not be lifted before the works to restore the reception centre are finalised given that the extent of the damage was very limited in any case
let me also remind you that the list of candidate and neighbouring countries is approved by parliament in various legal texts
in this respect a clear demarcation line should be drawn between the attributions of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer
reasons the answer has to be holistic and multi level it has to combine legislative and non legislative measures both of which are essential
there is only slow progress
concerning budget consolidation it is also important that the commission stop any proposal for eu legislation which means additional bureaucratic burdens and costs for member states for regions and local communities and the legislator has to do likewise
russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture with inventions and esprit
however the way to a european single market for mobile communication which has to be our ultimate goal is still far from being reached
we have a very good example
that is why we should have a full association agreement
turkey has enormous potential for economic growth and it has a strategic role as a corridor for the european union's energy supply complemented by the value of potential synergies between the eu and turkey the foreign policy and security policy can do a lot for us both
dutch citizens and taxpayers have for too long been the atm machine for dysfunctional member states
this means that in practice the international energy agency too has asked us to be more ambitious in our climate policies

there is no doubt that the driving force of trafficking is demand
i love my country and i am really worried
i hope that we will see a drastic decrease in funding for the failed eu project and that more money will come back to the taxpayers
thank you very much for being here with us
if we cannot make this cooperation work we will not reap the full benefit of this initiative and our efforts will be in vain
i would like to say as well that we should not only talk about better spending in the budget
now is the time to tell the syrians that if they want our help they need to break ties with iran hezbollah and hamas
there is a concern that the yukos case and related criminal prosecutions of individuals overshadow russia's reliability as a recipient of investment and a partner within the wto framework
the existing cooperation in the fields of energy education and others is a good basis for further cooperation
is there contact with the syrian national council and if so could she elaborate on this
today's proposals establish far reaching surveillance that goes beyond anything anticipated or justified
is it a new agreement or simply the reactivation of the agreement concluded with gaddafi
furthermore the afet opinion divides eligible countries into candidate potential candidate neighbourhood and in exceptional and duly justified circumstances strategically important third counties
mr president of course we have to make a very clear distinction i was talking about legislative proposals
such qualifications are necessary because it is the board that selects the officers and furthermore watches over their activity in order to report to shareholders and supervisors
we insist on the community method we say very clearly that we are not ready to agree on expenditure without a proper agreement on future own resources
is it really not possible to use other housing facilities with appropriate reception conditions in the meantime
after consultation with other political groups it reads as follows urges the russian government to commission an independent and impartial investigation into the yukos case' i believe this could be another step towards building confidence in russia's reliability as a wto partner and i kindly ask you to support this amendment
what does the high representative think of the resignation of professor ghalioun as chairman of the snc
madam president peaceful and non violent means are the only way to achieve a sustainable solution in the israeli palestinian conflict

it is outrageous to see a government in romania using the police and the secret service to intimidate political opponents restrict civil liberties and falsify elections
on the other hand we see islamic fundamentalists who have no desire to establish a proper democracy but only to further spread political islam throughout the region
it is important to know that afet proposed faster disbursement of macro financial assistance by the adoption of delegated acts for strategically important third countries only
there are also a few shortcomings
we can find different ways of doing this and where member states have got effective systems in place and there are many member states which do we need to take into account the fact that their systems work effectively
firstly the wording in the agreement does not make it binding enough
we all know about these important landmarks in russian history
does she share my fear that the snc is being hijacked by the muslim brotherhood and can she state that she will not cooperate with the muslim brotherhood in any way
this controversial technical issue should be resolved in that committee as well and between those parties
wto after eighteen years of negotiations
what democracy what human rights
however not all the essential goods are covered for that reason the eu has negotiated this agreement

this brings millions of vans into the remit without any recourse to an impact assessment
for turkey this means concrete results in the reform process and also an improvement in bilateral relations with its neighbours
i am aware of all the different systems but i guess my real concern here is that there is not one size that has to fit all
i believe that this will prove to be the most cost effective way to meet the eu air quality standards
it was initiated by him and we support it
i would like to hear from mrs ashton what kind of contact there is with syrian opposition groups
i would like to say as well that the position of the president of the commission is in some ways understandable but on the other hand there is a huge risk concerning giving up the community method and going back to national contributions in special instruments
last year this parliament by adopting a similar amendment achieved an important success in the field of human rights
i have a dream that every student applying to a university in any member state should be enabled to get a degree a qualification valid in all the territories of europe within the whole european labour market this is definitely one of the ways to build up european unity and european citizenship this is the deep meaning of this report

is the commission aware of this new agreement
there are not too many tools for the eu to enforce this agreement if russia does not fulfil its commitments therefore this agreement should be seen as a temporary solution until it is replaced by a legally binding agreement included in the new partnership and cooperation agreement
a key achievement is russia's commitment not to impose new or additional export duties
let me remind colleagues that in two thousand and eight all three institutions signed a declaration on communicating europe in partnership
this is all we can do
and the second part is the rest of the text
a proposal on the mff regulation and on a new inter institutional agreement
your question is fully justified this is exactly the question i am asking the danish presidency because the danish presidency is leading these talks and it must know for what reasons those countries are objecting
so i hope this will happen for russia as well and that russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in august this year
but if we need a mixed system then that should also be fine
finally mr president i hope that the commission will support parliament's position this time more than it did last time in
in the event it would like to do so russia should consult the european commission at least two months in advance
firstly it is essential for the european union to strengthen both political and economic ties with the country
because i believe that a self standing dcfta with our eastern neighbourhood is not a good solution
whilst companies in germany operate under such limits the uk does not it broadens the scope of the legislation enormously again without adequate justification many representatives of the uk freight and haulage industry strongly oppose plans to prevent operators carrying out their own tachograph calibration it is right that this amendment be lifted and i hope that it stays out of future proposals

ninety six amendment one thousand and sixty three concerning a new line on the actual and desired state of the economic potential in regions outside the greek capital athens this amendment refers to a new preparatory action and not a pilot project
until early presidential elections are held to be followed by parliamentary elections and the forming of a national coalition government and a committee to look into amendments to the constitution
make the point that we were told by mr schulz back in march after those ridiculous agriculture votes that this sort of vote would never take place again

nevertheless it is still important to have this discussion on the proposed introduction of the list rules' as my colleague already mentioned for the non preferential origin of goods and hear the commission's answers to our questions
what is needed is a powerful united movement of the iraqi working class which can undermine the sectarian forces and use the massive wealth in iraq to build a socialist society free from poverty and division
the report states very clearly that the current concept for the determination of non preferential origin of goods should be maintained
then there were two amendments adopted within the incorrect mff headings so they should be changed as follows amendment one thousand one hundred and fifty three preparatory action e platform for neighbourhood' should be included in heading one a and not heading

defence production is destined to become more european and arms export control mechanisms will need to reflect this new reality
they are working on their own central bank digital currency and at the end of the day the conclusion is the question is not if there will be digital currencies in the future but who will issue and control them
now we face the problem when the weapons export embargo will expire in two weeks
we know that they renege on their commitments
let me mention a few issues of great importance for us
the biodiversity strategy also mentioned that the eu must increase the quantity quality and resilience of its forest notably against fires droughts pests and diseases and other threats likely to increase with climate change
this could turn out to be a bigger risk than covid
an all ireland labour market and cross border access to services are essential to the lives of thousands of eu nationals living in ireland north and south as well as to the all ireland economy
despite that many countries are still unprepared in front of the second wave that is now hitting europe
and then you have to think of boosting the use of alternative fuels including hydrogen and the deployment also of the associated infrastructure
we must protect primary forests from being extracted
such disasters and crises cannot be resolved without cooperation and relying solely on national capacities member states especially smaller ones cannot afford to maintain high preparedness and large reserves in times of crises
let's ban these programmes completely
this alone would have well justified an increase in the budget for two thousand and twenty one but not only is the budget in decline but the sector is in difficulty and facing unprecedented crisis
forests we will take the european parliament's resolution fully into account when developing the upcoming forest strategy as well as the recently adopted resolution on the commission's communication on stepping up action to protect the world's forests which we
it's collecting huge amounts of data on citizens creating detailed profiles and selling them to advertisers and this has side effects
they will seek to destroy jobs across the european union to drive down pay and conditions and environmental standards both in britain and in the eu i urge the european council to hold firm in rejecting british provocations in asserting international law and in defending the interests of ireland and the eu
so please convey this huge concern to the people responsible for that
they have continually reinterpreted misinterpreted and ignored the good friday agreement to suit their own domestic political agenda
in my first discussion in the european parliament last september i spoke about the importance of mechanisms such as the crisis management coordination centre and the european capacity reserve of the resceu for crisis response
we all know the real problem is the partition of ireland and it would be wise for all of us to start preparing for irish unity
we know that they don't care about ireland north or south
in this chaos the european commission within its competences has quickly responded in the framework of the crisis and civil protection mechanisms in the eu and worldwide
the lebanese people are sick and tired of having to be resilient and i understand them
we call upon member states with the support of the commission to present the education policy priorities that have been identified to make our education and training systems more inclusive and more evident in the current context you must come up with a longterm vision for eu education policy
we deeply regret that the council is proposing budgetary cuts specifically in those programmes that support education and training policies
but despite great ambitions we are not yet at that point
the problem is complex
despite these alarms banks still often execute these transactions
therefore we urge the commission to develop a climate indicator which would be supplementary to the existing semester framework
it is encouraging to see the cooperation of the member states at work at key times when as individuals and as a community we face a threat to our security
so it's therefore important for all of us to keep this in mind during future discussions
today we call on the republic of the philippines to cease immediately all violence and human rights abuses
but to be honest we have to do more
but there is an option
we call on them to immediately cease the mauling of freedom of speech and to defend the universal value of freedom of speech
can we believe it
many of them are women who struggle in the face of patriarchal elites
and the call to revise the eib transport lending policy in order to open financial opportunities for sustainable and digital innovations
the right to access eu programmes and healthcare across the eu and the right to be represented in this parliament
they know who they are
this report is a political compromise that reflects the complex nature of the topic
regulatory clarity and certainty is needed for the public sector and for industry
employment opportunities especially for highly educated belarusians the european union has capacities and we can do it fast
i am ready to do whatever it takes to prevent my fellow croatians and other nations of the european union from going bankrupt
today our role is to facilitate a just transition and also recovery by linking those opportunities with the needs of people who don't want to fall into energy poverty where there are already about fifty million europeans
solidarity and volunteering are values that i as a social democrat and human being strongly support i honestly thank and extend my gratitude to everyone who selflessly helps fellow people and the communities
now you are learning what we have known all along
we therefore call on mozambique to investigate without delay the alleged accusations of human rights abuses against their security forces and to respect the fundamentals of international law
i think we also need to reaffirm our support for the right to freedom of belief
madam president i'm very happy that the council also focused on the digital sector which is absolutely crucial if we want to live in freedom and democracy in the future because today this way of living is involuntarily threatened by the business model of a few global tech companies
half of the cryptoassets transactions is linked to illegal activities like the buying or selling of illegal goods or services money laundering and payments in ransomware attacks
no product that indirectly results from illegal logging should be imported
it goes without saying that these changes are timely and very necessary
education is a right and access to digital education should not be a privilege anymore
we will ask the commission to come up with a legal framework to prevent this and make supply chains bringing products to our markets sustainable
as a former chief risk officer i can assure you there is no industry that is more regulated than the financial industry
therefore we are asking the council and the commission to present a transparent and complete assessment of the impact of the crisis
extreme temperatures forest fires floods storms earthquakes and even diseases are part of our reality and we always need to be able to respond effectively
the fight against illicit drugs must be pursued in full compliance with due process of law
i have met them they are young capable and visionary they fight for social justice human rights and sustainability
i call upon europe to support in any way possible the formation of such a government
first of all the promotion of reform is still the most important task of the semester the country specific recommendations were often extremely weakly implemented
this is pretty straightforward
on a much wider note i think the member states need to review policy regarding eritrea and in particular our financial support that keeps this despotic regime in power
banks must fill in one of these reports if they are worried one of their clients might be up to no good
our resolution and this is the goal of this debate calls to work closely together to minimise the health risks for staff and learners and to maximise the chances that inperson education and training is safe and can continue
we need to invest in infrastructure in digital skills and lifelong learning in improving the connectivity of remote areas in new initiatives like the european online university in the new tools curriculums and devices that have been developed across europe
it promotes sustainable forest management and strict protection
the british government wear their contempt for what they would refer to as foreign laws' just as they wear their hostility to the eu as a badge of honour
we will lose primary forests all around the world in a vain attempt to manage them sustainably
what we in the renew europe have done in this year's report is try to combine the existing macroeconomic core of the semester fiscal discipline and healthy debt levels with the urgent demands of today like the need for public and private investment social protection as well as the need to tackle climate change
there is no place for digital assets not meeting high level eu standards
at the same time we can't be naive and we need to look at it in a very accurate way indeed the previous debate on wirecard clearly demonstrates we have to draw the right lessons
the all ireland economy is not just about goods it's also about the free movement of people and services
i am asking for no charity i am asking to give people back what was taken from them by unjust crisis by artificial crisis and by bad policies
no wooden product sold in europe should come from illicit sources
we can have a new start in europe because in europe what we want are digital technologies to implement the european green deals and make the lives of european citizens better
but military insurgencies are no excuse for human rights violations reprisals and the government of mozambique has the responsibility to protect its citizens not make them fear for their lives
the eu will not be able to finance their green dream if the financial world cannot rely on the bafin
it is necessary to strengthen the civil protection mechanism and resceu and make them more flexible faster and better coordinated with national civil protection bodies
the sector is suffering from the consequences of the massive drop in demand for fisheries and aquaculture product throughout europe
let's make europe a better and safe place for ordinary people not for criminals
in many member states including slovenia protection against natural and other disasters is still strongly dependent on volunteers
as europeans we are sadly jointly responsible every day for deforestation for an incredible loss of biodiversity for speeding up climate change and for harming the rights of indigenous people for example when we simply order a ham sandwich at the station and so maybe consume meat from animals
it calls for balance
these enormous amounts of data as well as the staggering profits don't allow for a level playing field for our european industry and threaten democracies globally
the conversion and degradation of this ecosystem has been happening at a faster pace than for the amazon rainforest and it is crystal clear that these ecosystems will be exposed to increased pressure to be turned into agricultural land
we have to support them
you have left over one hundred million people after the last crisis in two thousand and eight in poverty
we need to regulate and supervise these providers properly finally it's critical that no one is left behind
the common travel area however does not allow for the free movement of eu nationals
but volunteers cannot and must not bear the burden of major global crises
nineteen the possible advantages are clear it can reduce prices and inefficiencies and increase transparency
a digital euro is not an option
we need to see the eu playing a more prominent role in shaping education policy and the first step could be to see better cooperation and coordination among member states on how to deal with the current crisis
therefore it's high time that you come forward with a proposal for review with an operational separation of the audit and non audit services under a direct eu supervision
on the other hand we have to remember that we in the eu must remain critical and very tough against tehran in dealing with the ideological opponent opposition iran needs to make further significant progress in the area of human rights if it wants to get more european engagement
they cannot be trusted the british legislation is not only a breach of the withdrawal agreement it is a full frontal assault on all aspects of our good friday agreement
we don't even know yet how many waves of lockdowns will hit europe we don't know how long and often restaurants and hotels will remain closed in the majority of member states with substantially reducing demand for fisheries and aquaculture products and business opportunities for our fishermen the amounts proposed by the commission are well below what is needed a drop by
the global preservation of forests and preventing their degradation are some of the biggest sustainability challenges of our time
we should find a way to give effect to these rights
we need to stop talking only about the energy targets we have to speak about how to implement these
crucial steps are needed to achieve this but we are opposing and fighting these steps even in this very house
we should stop pretending that there exists a single ultimate solution called sustainable forest management a remedy for deforestation
because the good friday agreement is based on rights
we know the mechanism that can help mandatory due diligence for all enterprises in our common market people in europe know that forests are the lungs of our planet
in my view it is not a good system but that is the current tool
we need a clear commitment
we think that the environmental effect of products must be a very important issue in the eu and the whole idea of an ecolabel gives a very useful orientation for consumers of course the ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products and the information should be clear and correct
that harsh treatment was meted out by mr pttering and mr siwiec the vice president replacing him later in the afternoon
we should not take away the right of free speech on this issue even if i do not agree at all with what he has to say
the paradigm of cosmopolitanism settles in our institutions and in our decisions and is now drawing a share of the action
real life examples show that solving issues related to education fuels strong community development
lose it is not about getting better times next year this is a fundamental world crisis that we need to take seriously
the two thousand and nine budget is finished
competitive framework for the development of the energy markets and for their efficient functioning this package depends on implementation as my colleague eluned morgan has just said and i do not believe that the fourth package is the solution
this report is the fruit of a lot of work
but let us be very careful because when we deal with a society that has been so traumatised it is far more important how our messages are heard there than how our messages are understood here
today the eu imposes big government increasing central control and the erosion of the nation state
this use of the word macedonian' cannot be replaced by any reference to any state name
better than ever
i maintain if the eu was the answer it must have been a very silly question
this text is a joint text adopted by most political groups and it is balanced
subject to the codecision procedure and as we move towards ratification of the lisbon treaty and a more simplified and united legal structure throughout the european union we should be seeing greater involvement of parliament in these issues not less
she was a prime minister who agreed that the legislation concerning the single market could be done by majority voting
however thirty years ago today mrs margaret thatcher was elected as british prime minister and she faced similar socialist caused problems to those that we face today crippling debts rising unemployment and public unrest she understood the solution was small government individual freedoms and national self determination
in the last ten years i have heard many criticisms of it including the lack of a level playing field insufficient stakeholder involvement inadequate balancing of economic social and environmental imperatives and too much by way of micro management from the centre
the european union has set up numerous programmes and financial instruments under the auspices of different agencies each covering only certain limited aspects of the problems that the developing countries are currently facing
gives the first steps within the magic of our rooms and our debates in this union machiavelli weakens for we were able to replace the sovereignty of powers with the sovereignty of men
however i believe that in our debate and in everything that we do with afghanistan we have to be very careful how we approach things because afghanistan is a country that has come through a violent repressive religious dictatorship
we have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text which is well balanced and addresses all our concerns on this matter and calls on international bodies to find a long term legal status for ashraf residents
it is important that we bear in mind that this epa is a stepping stone agreement which means that it is only a temporary solution in order for trade liberation to have a substantial positive effect on the whole region it is essential that ecowas sign a full epa
in fact the two amendments are in no way mutually exclusive and can therefore definitely both be voted on i therefore urge you to apply rule one hundred and sixty one of the rules of procedure and also allow a vote on amendment
of course it is for the israeli people their political leaders to decide on the composition of their new government
it is a much more important common policy and we cannot from the outset say that parliament will not have a bearing on that policy at all
i would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution we want to encourage you to continue as you have just said so that the czech presidency will be as successful in its second half as it was in its first half
my point is the following in a few weeks you will meet mr obama the new president of the united states
of course there is still a long way to go eliminating discards for example and there are times when the commission still seems to veer towards micro management i mention here article forty seven of the control regulation at least in its original version i have often said though that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker it takes a considerable time to turn round and i do believe that the control regulation will go a long way to achieving the necessary level playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned just as the development of regional advisory councils shall do much to bring improvements in other respects
colleagues from big groups elaborating the political message the chair wants to hear are treated with great generosity
in these hard times of the economic crisis we should respect the interests of producers as well and i am sure that this report balances the interests of the consumers and industry it is very important to involve small and medium sized enterprises in the ecolabel process and therefore the cost of the authorisation cannot be too high
third an integrated approach demands proper multilevel governance involving all stakeholders in the design and implementation of strategies
and parents in fulfilling their responsibilities are entitled to receive the necessary support from the community and the local authorities whose efforts to meet their obligations unfortunately often fail
european people's mutual commitment is truly the assumption of their common humanity
the sources of the reforms that we would hope to introduce to our rules of procedure come in part from the work of the reform working group established by the conference of presidents ably chaired by my colleague dagmar roth behrendt who made a number of proposals that were approved by the conference of presidents and have been forwarded to us to translate as best we can into the rules of procedure
two thousand and seven i think that it is important that the council can see the broad support from this parliament behind our demands to the council on more cooperation with parliament and its competent committees on the next discharge procedure
and add this vote to the list tomorrow when we have a lot of other things to do
every one of them was interviewed outside ashraf
to have those european world languages in today's globalised world in today's globalised economy in this global village which is cultural economic social and political is a most valuable asset for the entire eu which we must take full account of and
recently though i have been able to assure people that the policy is undergoing significant change
this house parliament knows just how difficult and how intractable the situation may seem
it was difficult and it was not clear at the very beginning that we would make it and that we would have greater europeanisation in this area
what must europe deliver when the g twenty meeting is resumed in september this year
after the anglo american military invasion in iraq the iranians who live there in exile got a guarantee of protection from iran
this will be a key to peace stability and development
mr president last week's elections in israel showed that the majority of citizens support the parties that see the reinforcement of the military as the best way to protect the country
you can declare adopted' or not adopted'
we should continue with the efforts to involve those countries more intimately
i agree with the intention to ensure that end users will be able to receive full information on the label even if the product is bought at a distance via the internet or telemarketing
the second source is a lot of smaller changes that in many ways have been in the pipeline for a long time but rather than have a string of reports changing the rules on minor points we have grouped them together
the time has come not to accept new demarcation lines between those who have been members of the european union for many years and those who came to the european union with a promise that this would be a better time for ordinary
i would not like to delete the truth now
together with a delegation of four members of this house i visited camp ashraf in october last year and met with american iraqi and un officials there
all our actions have this strategic objective in mind
i appreciate very much what you said but can you make sure that once you foresee this kind of simulation today that you invite some of the people who were actually in mumbai because it could give you some insight
you will one day realise that you cannot be masters in someone else's house
half how could you imagine that europe would put itself in a position where we are the ones who are doing less than our american friends and where we are the ones who are demanding more of our american friends how could you imagine respect for the european
it should in particular be noted that if the sale process is successful and correctly implemented companies acquiring the shipyard assets will not have to repay the illegal subsidies even if they choose to continue shipbuilding
however this practice which is not included in parliament's rules of procedure was introduced for the sole purpose of ensuring that the overall position on the budget adopted by parliament would remain within the financial limits set for the european parliament
now that is in breach of the rules of procedure where it is clearly stated how speaking time should be allocated
on the other side the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited
mr schulz the socialist group leader on the other hand was permitted by mr pttering to exceed his time limit by far more than a minute
despite various initiatives to improve the quality and the availability of health information studies indicate that patients want more information than they currently receive and that health professionals tend to overestimate the amount of information that is supplied
i can also remember her saying no' no' no' words the eu ignores or does not understand
we would like the european union to support this kind of agenda knowing that president obama has ambitions
second there must be an integrated approach with measurement in advance of the effect that sectoral policies would have at regional levels and the achievement of greater synergy between them
we say that we must attack the roots of the problem the roots of the crisis that we must radically change the economic paradigm that we must change and that we must curb all the speculation that has led us to this financial crisis
i mean that some european languages have the ability to establish a very intimate and close connection with various parts of the world and these are english spanish portuguese french and to a lesser extent and on different grounds german and italian
that dictatorship not only forces the inhabitants to live in conformity with its religious standards but also tries to kill everyone who does not conform to its system the consequence is that many iranians have to live in exile not only in europe but also in the neighbouring countries
you look it is a very important concept of symbiosis between political civilian and security aspects of
i would suggest that maybe the blue card procedure will be the same there are some hesitations now but let us try it out let us see how it works and i am confident we can make it work
mr president i intend to use somewhat less than my four minutes now in introducing it and maybe a little longer when i reply at the end if there are questions that need clarification
as those two had i believe in equal treatment and we can deal with an opinion
the situation of the polish shipyards cannot therefore be compared with that of other companies which have specific problems linked with the current financial crisis
that gives us a unique tool in peacemaking
is at the heart of his portfolio
from our side we hope that the new prime minister and government will be solid interlocutors for peace talks
we should call on the afghan authorities to take a look at the law to revise it and make sure that it is entirely in line with the international commitments of that country as well as its constitution
i find that without a central european union agency and a comprehensive and coherent policy the efforts that we are making to improve the situation in developing countries are not of notable extent
unfortunately our economies will still suffer for quite a while not least because of the public budgets and probably future inflationary facts of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess
she went on to make that now famous speech in bruges that sparked opposition to the project the eu is a fifty year old attempted answer to a two hundred year old problem
without truth and remembrance'
did she oppose his demands
the only answer was that the council had not discussed this matter
effort if we do not do that we will
it is a society in which people more than buildings have been hurt and destroyed
this meant the elimination of the leaders and elites of a nation fighting for its own and europe's freedom
for those reasons the commission had no other option but to adopt final negative decisions for the gdynia and szczecin shipyards ordering recovery of the illegal and incompatible aid granted to the yards however in order to limit
at the same time we need to do all we can to end the conflict between israelis and palestinians and between israel and the arab world
this is a question for the commission and council democracy cannot flourish without civil society and there is no civil society without participation
these people were born in the country or have spent most of their lives there and we are talking about more than fifteen of latvia's population or some three hundred and seventy two zero people
i just mentioned a few but this is another good reason to say no' so thank you for that
mr president thank you for your patience and indulgence
this is a step towards strong european supervision of the financial markets that have developed far beyond national borders
man is seen as a creature who is harmful to the environment without making a beneficial contribution
it wants to send a strong message to the iraqi government that the rights of these three four hundred people in ashraf including one zero women cannot be violated because of the pressures of the mullahs in iran
investing in broadband is ok but do not tell me that this is having any real effect on bringing down the free fall in jobs that we have right now
iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of ashraf residents parliamentary delegations human rights organisations lawyers journalists and even doctors to the camp and do not allow many logistical materials to get into ashraf
i believe that i speak on behalf of many of us when saying that this notion is mutual
certainly such impact assessment could pre empt certain problems such as those posed by the electronic identification of sheep in scotland
this means eliminating disparities within as well as between regions
including development cooperation'
the adverse economic and social consequences of these decisions the commission authorised poland to implement the recovery of the illegal aid through a controlled sale of the yards' assets and subsequent liquidation of the companies
we need a clear path and clear deadlines
please we cannot do it in this way you cannot do it in this way what we need is real investment
the same holds true for the intention to reinforce the provisions on market surveillance in order to ensure proper and eu wide harmonised enforcement of the energy labelling directive and its implementing measures
it must be reminded that democratisation is one of the goals of the eastern partnership and azerbaijan is part of that initiative
activities such as cultural scientific and economic exchange programmes citizen to citizen contacts or political dialogue are regrettably not covered by existing european legislation those being just a few examples
people let us now avoid new economic demarcation lines between the new ones and the old
independently of the adoption of the ecolabel regulation the commission confirms that it intends to propose a regulation on ecolabelling of fishery products before the end of this year to be mainly based on criteria for sustainable fishing
the recommendations of the european parliament and numerous other institutional organisations have been completely ignored
do you believe it is a state
what is more the yards continued to make losses were unable to pay taxes and social security obligations and have accumulated significant debts
they know that the emancipation of history is only possible through a project of political sharing and global justice
colleagues from smaller groups elaborating the political message the chair does not want to hear are treated with great meanness
we must rectify this situation and we ask the commission to consider the most adequate compensation measures for our passengers
we can do it if we take a new decision
thank you very much for your support
mr duff for instance right now may want to put a question to me about what i said and i would let him do so for thirty seconds under this rule if it is adopted
six three billion to counteract the negative effects of the economic crisis which is to say to accelerate implementation of the funds for the benefit of the real economy
the families of the victims in iraq cannot forget this fact and the iraqi constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the nko or the pkk on iraqi soil
president gorbachev was right the eu is the old soviet union dressed in western clothes
lastly the most important thing is that this report tries to establish a complete system of transparency not transparency for every institution separately but transparency on an interinstitutional basis where all the institutions are taken into account and where the principles of good administration
he is coming with an investment package
the election of president obama started a new chapter in transatlantic relations that has suffered serious setbacks
i remember when i first proposed the catch the eye period at the end of ordinary debates everyone said oh no we cannot do that it will mess up the speaking time of the groups and so on
i would add a further question to this as you are perfectly aware that a significant number of autochthonous national minorities and language minorities live in the eu fifteen million people ten of the population do you intend to incorporate the issue of these communities these national and language minorities
this should be nurtured and supported by all of us
it is in this same spirit that article two of the european convention of human rights declares the taking of life a flagrant violation
on the margins of the current transatlantic negotiations on data protection swift pnr the united states is expanding its national security agency data collection facilities so as to intercept every electronic message within its territory as well as all messages coming in and out of the country
this has not been done
minister vondra you promised that you would keep this parliament fully briefed
it must be stressed that advertising is key for free independent diverse and high quality media
the iraqi government has repeatedly requested different countries including many eu member states to receive them and we have not agreed
this is unacceptable
i watched in close up a legislative system that permits anonymous bureaucrats to generate so called law without any regard for the damage they do to the british economy and its businesses
i watched in horror an already overcrowded uk deluged by hundreds and thousands of uninvited foreign workers who arrive for their benefit and claim our welfare
madam president on a point of order i refer to rule one hundred and forty two and on the allocation of speaking time yesterday when we were discussing the guantnamo prison here in the chamber i and several other speakers were interrupted without mercy when we had exceeded our speaking time by a few seconds
the last and probably the most important point is transparency vis vis the citizens our role as a parliament is accountability vis vis the citizens we cannot and we must not say to the citizens that the big common policies like the external and defence policy will lie outside the democratic control of our parliament
four years ago i asked for a minute's silence to commemorate them but the house refused
we need to find urgent solutions to get aid in and to reduce the level of suffering of the people
business is demanding workers are demanding we are demanding do more
there is consequently a need for improved spatial analysis and the development of indicators against which policies can be designed and their impact assessed
i am sure mr president you would already let him do so now if he wanted but fortunately he does not want to
as if it had given up not only on solving the underlying conflict but also on upholding an increasingly fragile cease fire
important
i hope this will be covered by the universal service directive which is to come in the second half of the year
the second reason is interinstitutional equilibrium
too often the region has been plagued by cycles of violence rising extremism and economic hardship at the same time the conditions for europeans and americans to work together in the search for peace in the middle east are probably
i hear that the intention is to have a message and i hear that you intend to do something to help those who suffer most
the thrust of these reports the amendments that will be presented by the socialist members to improve them and also i think today's debate show very clearly that there are distinctive policies distinctive right wing and socialist policies towards the crisis
other main conclusions of the mission remain of global importance as well
i know that the commission president knows it and i am sure when we sit down together we can do more than we have done up to now
we need to take some technical measures and things will calm down by themselves and we must express our sympathy to the people who will be hit
to his credit i must say that this is the second modification of the rules of procedure
ahead the new us administration in cooperation with us has confirmed its intention to make full use of the
and as they say in star wars may the fourth be with you
europe's competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation
we would like to have a hearing on container security on both sides very soon
in an effective security strategy our european forces should have access to equipment and resources of the highest quality
we are saying we want to do our duty
so i would like to finish on a personal note by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the fisheries committee throughout and by thanking commissioner borg and his team for all that has been achieved in their five years at the helm
we are taking into account the charter of fundamental rights the proposals by the ombudsman and other agencies and the case law of the court
as commissioner barrot has underlined in each individual country of the union there is a clear and more often than not official legal framework that ensures the protection of our cultural diversity
the european union and its member states have contributed immensely to the official development assistance and it should never be underestimated but much remains to be done to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the institutional framework as well as congruence of the legislation
the eu must take action on their behalf
however one aspect was left out the situation of thousands of european children left behind by parents who go to work in another european country generally called the migration orphans' of which there are almost three hundred and fifty zero in my country
a day will come when the peoples of asia of the americas and of africa will get together
second i call for the rejection of two motions for a resolution on the implementing measures rejecting implementing measures on tvs and fridges
as vice chair of the delegation for relations with canada i even had to witness at one point a situation where canada acted as a mediator between the european union and the united states
this is the democratic principle and this is what we are about to do
middle east we are possibly at a threshold we can choose to pursue the same policies in the same manner knowing that they will lead to the same results the results that
i would very much like to see a very substantial debate on how europe intends to take advantage of our unique educational system so that we remain united in our diversity
as unicef and other organisations have underlined several times it affects a huge amount of children in the world and in europe
let us not make this a beauty contest about who is more or less ambitious more realistic or less realistic or more or less willing to pay we need four clarities because too much is at stake we need a clear and ambitious political stance
however at the same time deeper international engagement remains essential
it is our responsibility to raise awareness of this gross abuse of power and violation of our basic rights
the iranian supreme leader in an official announcement at the end of february asked the visiting iraqi president to implement the mutual agreement to close down camp ashraf and expel all its residents from iraq
today our parliament is paying special attention to the current situation by adopting a resolution only on ashraf
two thousand of these people have registered themselves with the high commissioner for refugees hoping to be transferred to other countries ready to accept them and for several years now the iraqi government has been working closely with unhcr asking other countries to accept them dear colleagues this is the business of iraq
i think that it is becoming a tradition once a year to hold this debate and i am very happy to participate
they all reinforced our concern for the legal status of ashraf's residents because its security was transferred from american troops to iraqi forces at the beginning of this year
the socialist position is much more complex
firstly increasing energy efficiency is the quickest and the most cost effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions secondly energy efficiency can be part of the solution to the current economic recession addressing energy demand and energy use can help create long lasting growth and solid job opportunities
i strongly support the idea that it is absolutely essential to develop training communication courses for the health workforce in order to provide clearer and more complete information to patients
my second point i welcome president obama's commitment to diplomacy with the islamic republic of iran
the situation in which social and economic risks are made worse by the absence of parents who cannot meet their children's needs for care protection and education may lead to an increase in vulnerability the primary responsibility for the development of the child rests with the parents
by working together by acting together we define who we
so we must send a united message without amendments that would undermine and weaken this resolution which only covers the humanitarian issues of ashraf residents
